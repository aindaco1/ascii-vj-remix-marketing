# Rendering Engine

This document describes how ASCII VJ Remix renders sources into ASCII/cell
visual output across browser and Tauri desktop contexts.

Related practice docs:

- [Performance](/docs/operations/performance/) for renderer/output latency and FPS validation.
- [Security](/docs/operations/security/) for local media, Tauri capability, updater, and
  FFmpeg sidecar boundaries.
- [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/) for the current renderer, media, native output, and
  release validation matrix.
- [Accessibility](/docs/operations/accessibility/) and [Internationalization](/docs/operations/internationalization/) for
  control-surface UX rules that affect renderer-facing controls.

## Architecture Properties

- WebGPU/WebGL output is the visual-quality target.
- ASCILINE-derived Canvas and adaptive-stream paths remain available as
  compatibility and development infrastructure.
- Normal app use is local-first and offline.
- All live controls route through one canonical parameter model.
- Presets, WTF mode, audio reactivity, and MIDI control compose without forking
  renderer state.
- Pop Out uses latest-frame native paths where available to minimize live-camera
  latency.
- Palette, ordered-dither, glyph, and density behavior is defined once in
  shared catalogs/math and implemented by each backend without parallel state.

## High-Level Data Flow

```text
Source selection
  -> source adapter
  -> canonical params
  -> optional live modulation
  -> effective params
  -> renderer runtime
  -> main preview
  -> optional native/browser Pop Out
```

Source selection can come from built-in media, user-selected files, camera
streams, mixed cameras, or development stream sessions. The renderer runtime
chooses the best backend for the active source and environment.

## Source Layer

### Built-In Media

The visible built-ins are:

- Demo Image: `media/demo.svg`.
- Demo Video: `media/demo-video-2.mp4` (H.264) on macOS and Windows, and
  `media/demo-video-2.webm` (VP8) on Linux so clean Linux webviews do not
  require an optional H.264 GStreamer plugin. Both URLs represent the same
  logical built-in source; saved selections normalize to the current platform.
  If the webview cannot decode either asset, the same bundled FFmpeg raw-frame
  source used for selected videos takes over locally.

Additional bundled media files remain hidden development fixtures for parity
tests and performance smoke tests.

### Custom Files

Browser mode uses browser file APIs and blob URLs. Tauri mode uses a native
dialog command and registers the selected file under a session-local media id.
That media id is exposed to the webview through Tauri's asset protocol.
MKV files use the bundled FFmpeg raw-frame path immediately. Other selected
videos try the platform decoder first and retry through bundled FFmpeg if that
decoder rejects the file.

The important security boundary is that the renderer receives a playable media
URL or registered id. It does not gain broad filesystem access.

### Cameras

Browser camera capture uses `getUserMedia`.

For a single camera:

```text
MediaDevices.getUserMedia
  -> hidden video element
  -> MediaSource abstraction
  -> WebGPU/WebGL2/Canvas renderer
```

For multiple cameras:

```text
N camera streams
  -> hidden video elements
  -> Canvas2D mixer
  -> captured/mixed media source
  -> renderer
```

Camera controls include device selection, capture size, FPS, layout, framing,
and mirror. Facing-mode controls are hidden when irrelevant to the selected
device capabilities.

Tauri native Pop Out has platform-owned single-camera paths:

```text
macOS: AVFoundation capture
Windows: Media Foundation source reader
Linux: bundled FFmpeg V4L2 input
  -> latest BGRA/RGB frame
  -> native output renderer
```

Native Pop Out presentation avoids WebView canvas readback and per-frame Tauri
IPC. Windows uses one exclusive native owner for both views;
its latest camera frame is downscaled, JPEG-encoded, and returned through a
binary Tauri response to a canvas consumed by the existing WebGPU preview.
Linux pauses the main WebView camera preview while an exclusive V4L2 device is
owned by native Pop Out, then reacquires it on close. Windows/Linux preflight
one frame before showing native output and retry through the bounded mirror if
native device opening fails. Windows keeps the preflight capture alive instead
of opening the same device twice. Its asynchronous Media Foundation callback
feeds a latest-frame slot independently of GPU rendering and preview reads.

### Audio

Audio is not a visual source. It is an analysis source that modulates render
params.

Browser audio sources:

- local audio file.
- mic/input through `getUserMedia`.
- display/tab audio through `getDisplayMedia` when the platform exposes an
  audio track.

Tauri desktop audio sources:

- browser/Web Audio providers where available.
- native system/input audio feature providers for desktop builds.

The audio layer outputs bounded feature vectors, not raw audio buffers or raw
visual frames.

### Stream Sessions

Stream sessions are development and advanced infrastructure. They are not a
normal user-facing source.

Legacy path:

```text
Python/FastAPI/OpenCV
  -> ASCILINE frame preparation
  -> adaptive WebSocket frames
  -> JS decoder
  -> Canvas stream runtime
```

Rust/FFmpeg path:

```text
registered media id
  -> Rust media session
  -> FFmpeg probe/decode
  -> Rust frame preparation
  -> adaptive encode
  -> Tauri batch read
  -> StreamRuntime
```

The normal Source UI hides stream mode. Prospective productization work is
tracked in the [Roadmap](/docs/reference/roadmap/).

## Parameter Model

The app maintains one canonical parameter object, commonly referred to in code
as `params`.

Major parameter groups:

- source: source mode, media URL/id, media type, source name.
- camera: selected device ids, resolution, FPS, layout, framing, mirror.
- backend: auto, WebGPU, WebGL2, Canvas2D, Pixel Canvas.
- grid: columns, rows, auto rows, cell width, cell height, aspect correction,
  global Advanced Density preference.
- color: saturation, contrast, brightness, gamma, background blend,
  quantization, palette id, palette mapping.
- dither: ordered matrix, strength, scale, bias, invert.
- sampling: FPS, jitter amount, jitter speed, sample X/Y, smoothing.
- glyph/cell: glyph mode, solid mode, character set, custom typed ramp, depth,
  offset, reverse, glyph-color mode/color, background color, neutral atlas
  style, font family metadata, minimum glyph intensity.
- stream: codec, quality, tolerance, buffer settings, frame timing.
- UI/performance: stats overlay, transition seconds.

The control surface, presets, persistence, source changes, WTF mode, audio
reactivity, native output, and MIDI all read from or write through this
model.

Static renderer-family transitions keep media ownership at the `StaticRuntime`
layer. Canvas2D, pixel Canvas, WebGL, and WebGPU renderers can crossfade over
the same live video/camera source instead of destroying and reloading media when
`solidMode`, `glyphMode`, `pixel`, or `backend` changes.

### Shared Renderer Math

Shared helpers reduce duplicated renderer math without changing the established
Canvas or stream output.

Shared JavaScript helpers live in:

```text
renderers/shared/character-sets.js
renderers/shared/density-policy.js
renderers/shared/glyph-atlas.js
renderers/shared/palettes.js
renderers/shared/render-math.js
renderers/shared/render-math-vectors.json
```

The shared module currently owns:

- GPU-style color processing used by software snapshots and native parity tests.
- Legacy Canvas color processing.
- Legacy stream color processing.
- shader-style jitter hash helpers.
- a bounded canonical character-set catalog, including credited ascii.today
  adaptations.
- complete approved Unicode coverage metadata and bounded custom-ramp
  validation.
- project-native palette ids/colors, a cached 32x32x32 palette lookup table,
  and immutable Bayer matrices.
- shared accelerated/software column and total-cell density limits.
- Unicode-scalar glyph ids, 1024px atlas page addressing, cached max-coverage
  browser mips, a four-page decoded cache, and lazy local page loading.
- compact charset and luminance-to-glyph helpers.

The Canvas and stream functions are intentionally named separately from the GPU
function. Their established quantization and background-blend behavior remains
distinct while shared vectors protect compatibility.

`npm run test:render-math` validates the JavaScript helpers against shared
vectors. Rust native output tests consume the same vector file for GPU color
processing parity.

### Effective Params

Some features affect live rendering without changing saved state.

Audio reactivity is the main example:

```text
base params
  + audio feature modulation
  -> effective params
  -> renderer.updateParams()
```

Effective params must not persist back into user presets unless the user
explicitly saves the current state as a preset.

Audio feature polling and reactive output synchronization target 120 Hz, with
at most one native feature read in flight. Duplicate capture frames and replies
from stopped sessions are ignored. Browser FFT analyzers do not add smoothing;
both capture paths use the shared immediate-attack, elapsed-time release
envelope. Smoothing zero bypasses the envelope. Native input requests 128-frame
buffers within the device's supported range and retains the default-buffer
fallback. Beat history and decay follow time rather than callback count.
Steady Pop Out updates consume these effective parameters without applying audio
a second time. Armed native transitions receive unmodulated endpoints and keep
their direct native audio response while parameter synchronization is suspended.

## Backend Selection

Backend `auto` attempts the highest-quality viable path first.

Typical browser priority:

1. WebGPU.
2. WebGL2.
3. Canvas2D.
4. Pixel Canvas when selected or required.

The user can override the backend manually. Controls that do not apply to the
active backend are hidden or disabled.

Backend choice is resolved once per renderer construction in
`renderers/gpu/ascii/renderer/backend-policy.js`; it is not evaluated in the
frame loop. Only an explicitly selected Canvas backend bypasses GPU
construction. Platform identity and user agent do not change preset ownership:
packaged macOS, Windows, and Linux views all attempt the same WebGPU, WebGL2,
then Canvas fallback order. Native Pop Out backend selection is separate and
unchanged.

## WebGPU Renderer

The WebGPU renderer is the primary quality target.

Video sources use `importExternalTexture()` per frame. Image sources upload once
with `copyExternalImageToTexture()` into a `texture_2d<f32>`.

The renderer uses a two-stage GPU flow:

1. Cell pass:
   - divide the source into a grid.
   - sample one point per cell.
   - apply animated per-cell jitter.
   - optionally mirror X.
   - apply color processing, ordered thresholding, and palette lookup.
   - write one processed color per cell to a storage texture.
2. Render pass:
   - draw a fullscreen triangle.
   - map output pixels to cells using cell width/height.
   - fetch the processed cell color.
   - fill the output canvas or mask it through the selected Unicode glyph ramp.

Color processing includes:

- saturation boost around luminance average.
- contrast boost around midpoint.
- brightness.
- gamma.
- optional color quantization.
- background blend toward the app's dark canvas color.
- optional Bayer 2x2/4x4/8x8 ordered dithering.
- optional nearest-color or luminance-ramp palette mapping through a palette
  lookup buffer that changes only when palette/mapping changes.

Jitter uses a deterministic hash seeded by cell position and time, so static
images can animate without changing source media.

Uniform ArrayBuffers/DataViews, texture views, and bind groups whose resources
do not change are created once and reused. Browser video still imports an
external texture and creates its source-dependent compute binding per frame;
when supported, a `VideoFrame` holds the decoded image through `queue.submit`
and closes in `finally`. This avoids WebKit's cached HTML-video texture
lifetime during decoder and window transitions. The
[WebGPU external-texture contract](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#external-texture-creation)
keeps a VideoFrame-backed texture valid until its frame closes. Decoder gaps
skip a frame; other GPU failures remain reportable. Failed submissions do not
advance frame counters or feedback history, and the animation loop reschedules
even after an error. Grid/source rebuilds create a new
renderer and therefore a new complete resource set.

The glyph renderer decodes only atlas pages needed by the active ramp, then
packs up to 96 Unicode-scalar masks and their five max-coverage levels into a
two-row 768x62 RGBA texture. Keeping the compact width below 1024 pixels avoids
the Apple WebKit wide-upload boundary while retaining constant-time texture
lookup in the fragment pass. Atlas pages are generated offline, locally
bundled, and loaded through their asset URLs. Live audio/transition updates
compare a compact glyph input key before resolving ramps or touching atlas
resources.

## WebGL2 Renderer

The WebGL2 backend mirrors the WebGPU visual model as closely as practical:

- video frames upload with `texImage2D()` per frame.
- images upload once.
- first pass samples one color per cell into a cell-color texture.
- first-pass palette/dither math matches the shared contract.
- palette lookup textures retain their data row order while source images keep
  their own vertical-flip setting.
- second pass expands the cell-color texture and optionally samples the same
  Unicode-scalar atlas/ramp contract as WebGPU.
- shader uniforms match the WebGPU parameter set where possible.
- all 18 shader uniform locations are cached after program linking rather than
  queried again during each frame.

WebGL2 is the most important browser GPU fallback because it is widely available
on machines that do not expose WebGPU.

The clean-profile visual default and renderer preference have separate owners:
Classic Camera ASCII supplies the initial visual parameters, while the global
backend remains Auto. A built-in preset inherits Auto unless it explicitly
declares a compatibility backend. This keeps solid/pixel presets on WebGPU or
WebGL2 while preserving intentional Canvas2D ownership for traditional text
presets and Paper Shredder.

`StaticRuntime` treats GPU construction as a recoverable operation. If the
requested WebGPU/WebGL2 renderer cannot initialize, it creates the equivalent
Canvas renderer for both initial startup and live preset transitions. A failed
Canvas fallback leaves the previous transition surface active.

Physical Windows 11 WebView2 acceptance found a narrower failure mode: GPU
construction and frame counters succeeded, but glyph-atlas output stayed
blank, while solid/pixel output remained visible. The earlier response routed
all Windows glyph previews through Canvas2D, collapsing the accelerated set to
roughly seven presets. The compact active-ramp glyph texture has since replaced
the problematic glyph upload path, so the 1.0 release retired that blanket
route. The current Windows preset matrix must preserve 62 accelerated and 28
explicit Canvas presets. A real renderer-construction failure still falls back
to Canvas2D.

## Canvas Renderers

Canvas paths preserve ASCILINE compatibility and low-level fallback behavior.

Canvas2D glyph/text mode renders character-like cells. Pixel Canvas renders
colored block/pixel data more directly.

Canvas uses the same palette catalog, lookup table, ordered thresholds, and
bounded active glyph ramp. It does not load operating-system fonts into the
native output path and remains governed by the lower software density ceiling.

These paths are important for:

- older browsers or webviews.
- stream-frame compatibility.
- testing the adaptive codec output.
- environments where GPU initialization fails.

Canvas fallback remains functional even though it is not the highest-quality
path.

## Static Runtime

`StaticRuntime` manages browser-native local sources and GPU/Canvas backends.

Responsibilities:

- load or rebuild the active source.
- choose backend.
- start and stop media playback.
- keep the renderer alive across live-safe param changes.
- rebuild renderer surfaces when structural params change.
- preserve video playback state when changing presets that do not change the
  source.
- update stats.

Renderer construction records a bounded sequence of structured events. A GPU
failure that activates Canvas, or a total transition failure, queues one
deduplicated Reports item with requested/resolved backend, preset, source class,
and recent event summaries. Reporting is asynchronous and never blocks the
fallback or transition; no frame, media payload, or arbitrary local log is
included.

For structural changes, the runtime uses layered renderer surfaces:

```text
old renderer stays visible
  -> new renderer initializes behind or beside it
  -> non-structural params tween
  -> surfaces crossfade
  -> old renderer is destroyed
```

This avoids black frames during preset transitions.

When native Pop Out is active, the controller arms one transition contract
containing the old and new canonical params, transition kind, duration, and a
shared Unix-clock start time. The primary view and native display link then
derive progress independently from that same timestamp. Numeric transitions
use the shared easing function; structural renderer-family transitions render
both native states and composite them with the same outgoing-opacity curve as
the layered primary view. Animation-frame IPC updates are suppressed until the
contract completes, then one final canonical state is sent.

For a non-structural numeric tween, only controls whose values are changing are
synchronized during animation frames. Source lists, camera-device options,
visibility, meters, persistence, and the complete control surface are reconciled
at the final state boundary. This is a UI-work optimization only; effective
renderer params and native/Pop Out synchronization still advance during the
tween.

## Stream Runtime

`StreamRuntime` handles ASCILINE-style encoded frame streams.

It can consume:

- WebSocket frames from the legacy Python/FastAPI server.
- native Rust/FFmpeg session batches in Tauri development paths.

Stream frames carry INIT metadata and framebuffer messages. The JS decoder
supports:

- legacy raw frames.
- adaptive RAW.
- adaptive ZLIB.
- adaptive DELTA.

Stream mode is hidden from the normal Source UI and retained as development
infrastructure.

## Adaptive Codec

The adaptive codec exists to reduce bandwidth compared with sending the full
framebuffer every frame.

Each encoded frame chooses one of:

- RAW: full framebuffer.
- ZLIB: compressed framebuffer.
- DELTA: cells changed since the previous frame.

Codec quality can allow tolerance-based temporal deltas for color planes while
keeping character planes exact where applicable.

Compatibility rules:

- existing legacy clients can still receive raw frames.
- JS and Rust decoders must stay compatible with Python-generated vectors.
- codec changes require vector tests.

## Rust/FFmpeg Media Pipeline

The Rust/FFmpeg path ports the Python/FastAPI stream preparation path toward a
desktop-packaged local engine.

Current shape:

```text
Tauri selected or vetted bundled media
  -> Rust registry id or exact bundled source id
  -> ffprobe metadata
  -> ffmpeg RGB frame reader
  -> frame preparation
  -> adaptive encoder
  -> native session batches
  -> StreamRuntime or validation tools
```

Key modules:

- `media_engine::ffmpeg`: FFmpeg/ffprobe process boundary, video probe, RGB
  reader, camera reader options.
- `media_engine::frame_prep`: ASCILINE-compatible text/color/pixel framebuffer
  preparation.
- `media_engine::codec`: adaptive codec encoder/decoder.
- `media_engine::pipeline`: decode -> prep -> encode -> optional decode
  verification.

Frame preparation modes:

- text mode: grayscale to ASCII palette.
- color modes 2 through 5: `[char, R, G, B]` cells with quantized color levels.
- pixel mode: `[B, G, R]` cells.

The Rust path complements rather than replaces the WebGPU/WebGL static renderer.
It provides packaged stream-style media preparation and native decoder
integration. Bundled source ids resolve only the shipped MP4 and WebM demo
assets; they do not expand the asset protocol or expose arbitrary paths.

## Native Output Renderer

The native output renderer exists because a second WebView-rendered pop-out was
too expensive for low-latency live output.

Desktop flow:

```text
main UI params/source state
  -> Tauri native output command
  -> native output state
  -> source frame acquisition
  -> native `wgpu` presenter
  -> output window
```

For file-backed images/videos, Rust resolves bundled resources or registered
media ids, decodes frames, uploads the latest frame to the GPU, applies cell
color math, and presents through the native swapchain.

The native GPU surface prefers non-sRGB `Bgra8Unorm` or `Rgba8Unorm`, matching
the browser canvas encoding expected by the shared color math. Platform-reported
sRGB formats remain a last-resort fallback when no unorm surface is available.

On the macOS display-link path, the decoded source-frame version is passed to
the presenter. When that version and the frame dimensions have not changed, the
presenter reuses the existing source texture while still encoding/presenting
with the latest visual and audio-reactive params. Unversioned fallback callers
retain unconditional uploads. Logs expose source upload and skip counters.

For single-camera output, AVFoundation on macOS, Media Foundation on Windows,
and the bundled local FFmpeg V4L2 input on Linux capture frames directly for the
native presenter. Live camera presets do not use browser mirror transport by
default because canvas readback and IPC frame transfer are too expensive for
sustained output. Multiple cameras and native-open failures keep the bounded
mirror path.

Native output consumes the same canonical palette, dither, `glyphMode`,
character-set/custom-ramp, depth/offset/reverse, and glyph/background color
params as the control surface. The native `wgpu` presenter fuses palette and
ordered-dither work into its cell pass, then masks cells through the same
Unicode-scalar page/ramp contract as the browser GPU renderers.

The frontend resolves the selected catalog entry into a bounded base
`charsetRamp`; Rust validates supported scalars and applies depth, offset, and
reverse once to create a maximum 96-id ramp. Required 1024px R8 atlas pages are
decoded/uploaded lazily and retained in the presenter's fixed 16-layer texture.
Windows also uploads the four max-coverage mip levels used by the browser's
tiny-cell glyph path. macOS and Linux retain their existing base-page sampling.
`fontFamily` remains preview/control-surface metadata; native output never loads
arbitrary system or user fonts.

For fallback/mirrored sources, bounded raw pixel snapshots can be sent from the
main renderer to the native output.

Native output design rules:

- output window does not own broad Tauri permissions.
- presenter consumes the latest params live.
- latest-frame semantics are preferred over deep buffering.
- Windows/Linux source and mirror-mode changes stop and join the previous
  native worker before reusing the output window. Surface validation or raw
  handle loss during normal close/replacement is recoverable teardown, not a
  process panic or crash-report event.
- Windows/Linux native camera capture must produce a preflight frame before the
  output window opens. Windows retains that capture as the sole owner. Both
  platforms restore the WebView camera before mirror fallback or after an
  exclusive native session closes. During a Windows exclusive session, a
  bounded latest-frame binary JPEG bridge keeps the main WebGPU preview live;
  Windows emits its close event only after the Media Foundation worker has
  released the device. Windows matches the
  optional Chromium USB model suffix only when the Media Foundation friendly
  name match is unambiguous.
- primary renderer behavior must not regress when Pop Out is open.
- browser fallback must remain available.

## Audio-Reactive Modulation

Audio analysis updates effective render params at frame rate.

Features:

- RMS.
- bass.
- low-mid.
- mid.
- high-mid.
- treble.
- presence.
- brightness.
- density.
- spectral flux.
- beat pulse.
- phase/sway.

Dense-mix dampening uses the density feature to reduce beat/flux-heavy
modulation during crowded broadband passages without muting sparse transients.

Capture startup and feature reads share a generation guard. Stop invalidates
pending work, releases late browser streams, and serializes native start/stop
commands so an old stop cannot terminate a new session. Only the current
generation can change error/status state. Audio preset selection shares one
tuning helper between UI and MIDI, restores all audio sliders, and preserves
source/device/enabled state. Custom tuning is shown explicitly in the selector.
Audio edits or Stop hand an autonomous native transition back to app-driven
updates, including when an arm acknowledgement arrives after the edit.

Modulation targets are live-safe visual controls:

- brightness.
- contrast.
- saturation.
- gamma.
- background blend.
- jitter amount.
- jitter speed.
- sample offsets.

Structural controls such as source, backend, grid allocation, and camera devices
are not modulated per beat because they would cause renderer churn.

## Presets, WTF Mode, and MIDI

These are all control layers over the same parameter model.

Presets:

- apply known parameter sets.
- start in Flat Media for every built-in look; saved custom looks retain their
  selected visual mode. Scene recipes remain available for manual opt-in.
- may specify transition duration.
- can be saved/imported/exported by users.

WTF mode:

- creates randomized target params.
- anchors some random states around extreme preset families and traditional
  ASCII presets.
- independently selects Flat Media with 80% probability, otherwise selecting
  evenly from the canonical non-flat visual modes. The choice is made once
  before visual-safety retries and retained by the fallback. Spatial targets use
  the matching recipe's camera settings and Auto backend; normal renderer
  fallback still applies. Anchor color/glyph styles remain randomized.
- transitions indefinitely until stopped.
- avoids unsafe all-white/all-black states.

Experimental MIDI:

```text
UC-33e DIN output
  -> mioXC/CoreMIDI
  -> bounded Rust event queue
  -> frame-coalesced mapping engine
  -> canonical visual/audio target
  -> params/effective params
  -> main preview and native Pop Out synchronization
```

- Uses the same ranges, clamps, setters, and structural metadata as visible UI
  controls.
- Applies base visual or audio-reactive settings; it does not fork renderer
  state or write audio-derived effective params back into presets.
- Re-arms soft takeover after visual preset changes.
- Keeps button edges ordered while coalescing high-rate continuous changes.
- Restricts actions to visual params, audio-reactive settings, visual presets,
  and WTF mode. Sources, Camera, Pop Out, and output displays are not targets.
- Uses four channel-addressed UC-33e pages and stable numeric preset slots.
- Captures/restores bounded opaque SysEx packets through the selected mioXC
  output without exposing MIDI permissions to the output window.
- The mapping and transport layers are automated-test covered, but physical
  full-bank restore/verification remains an experimental acceptance gap.

See [UC-33e and mioXC MIDI Control](https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/blob/main/docs/MIDI_UC33E.md) for the physical map.

## Packaging and Offline Runtime

The renderer must not depend on online assets at runtime.

Packaged assets include:

- frontend bundle.
- renderer code.
- GPU assets.
- fonts.
- built-in demo media.
- Tauri native code.
- reviewed FFmpeg sidecars.

Production CSP blocks arbitrary remote HTTP(S) runtime access. The asset
protocol is scoped narrowly and session-locally for user-selected media.

## Validation

The maintained validation matrix and commands live in [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/).
Use its [renderer backend checks](/docs/operations/testing/#renderer-backend-changes),
[native output checks](/docs/operations/testing/#native-output-or-pop-out-changes), and
[media checks](/docs/operations/testing/#ffmpeg-and-media-engine) for the affected paths.

Prospective renderer, camera, stream, audio, and MIDI work is tracked only in
the [Roadmap](/docs/reference/roadmap/).

## Indexed Palette Cycling

`renderers/shared/palette-contract.json` owns the 256-color / eight-range bounds.
Palettes contain immutable base colors and non-overlapping inclusive ranges.
The source-to-index LUT always uses base colors; a separate RGBA display table
animates their RGB entries. Alpha stores base luminance so cycling never changes
the glyph mask. Off is the compatibility default. The catalog has 21 palettes
and the preset contract is 90 total, 62 accelerated, 28 explicit Canvas.

`palette-cycling.js` owns range validation, signed modulo, classic/blended lookup,
amount and the integrated speed transport. `cell-color.wgsl.js` supplies common
browser/native WGSL color processing. Rust's small evaluator consumes the same
JSON contract and golden vectors; WebGL2 samples a 256×1 RGBA32F texture, while
Canvas and native software evaluate the same display table once per frame.

The app owns one monotonic transport shared by both sides of a transition and
browser Pop Out. Native state includes a sender clock sample; Rust rebases that
anchor to its local monotonic clock on synchronization, including reopen/resume.
IPC delivery latency is the remaining phase uncertainty. Speed ramps integrate
the existing easing curve instead of resetting time. Runtime clocks are excluded
from saved settings, import/export, and preset definitions.

Lookup tables, pipelines, glyph data and source textures remain independent of
the cycling display table. Native/browser output receives the same controls;
mirrored output receives already-rendered pixels and applies no second cycle.

## Spatial stage (1.1.0)

`renderers/shared/spatial-contract.json` owns defaults, enumerations, limits and
control labels. JS normalization, UI and Rust validation consume that contract;
`spatial-audio.json` owns the additional bounded audio routes. Scene transport
uses the existing palette transport integrator with its own state, so signed
speed changes preserve phase, and native output rebases the sender clock.
Transport/reset state is runtime-only and is excluded from saved presets.

`spatial-shader.wgsl.js` contains original, shared scene and post-color math.
WebGPU and native wgpu use it directly. `spatial-shader.js` lowers its small,
explicitly typed syntax subset to GLSL; it is not a general WGSL translator.
Real shader compilation and pixel comparisons cover both languages.
`spatial-canvas.js` is the software geometry/effect reference.

The initial engine casts a camera-plane ray per cell with at most 64 DDA steps
and a 40-unit distance bound. It continues past low blocks, intersects roofs,
and compares floors/ceilings with wall depth. The map repeats every 32 units of
travel and bounds lateral geometry. Facade hashes sample just inside the hit
surface to avoid rounding across a grid boundary. Lighting is directional plus
an artistic contact term and analytic window glow, not global illumination.
Wet floors launch one bounded reflected ray with ripple perturbation; rain uses
four world-space sheets clipped against opaque depth. Orbitals uses at most 48
sphere-tracing steps. Relief reads source luminance as block height. Surface framing accounts for
the physical tile aspect (2:1 on walls, square on horizontal surfaces). Larger
wall panels, roof/ceiling sampling and the orbital backdrop preserve visible
source structure; optional scene recipes blend in 80–95% source media.
Camera-plane rays include pitch. Corridor uses a narrow, low tunnel; Cathedral
intersects a two-plane pitched roof; Coast keeps low shoreline blocks and no
road markings. Relief samples one source-aligned height/color field without
roads, from an elevated camera. Orbitals rotates its camera and tilts its ring.
The spatial uniform block is ten vec4s (160 bytes), including camera pitch and fractal zoom/detail/shape in the final vec4.

Recursive ruins, Mandelbulb and Mandelbox share a 64-step, 32-unit sphere tracer with up to eight estimator iterations. The Mandelbulb first intersects its
containing sphere to skip empty rays and travel; its shared radial power is
computed once per estimator iteration. Mandelbrot uses at most 128 iterations, smooth escape color and a bounded zoom cycle that stays within useful float32 precision. Slow-escaping boundary color fades into the interior to reduce numerical shimmer. Ruins use a periodic box field with recursive cross-shaped cuts; the bulb uses spherical power iteration, and the box uses box/sphere folds. Source media controls surface color, glyph luminance and Mandelbrot contour distortion. No external code or runtime assets are fetched.

Scene RGB enters the existing color/palette/dither stage. The cell alpha channel
still addresses a glyph; it does not carry depth. Optional material/edge glyphs
append eight symbols to at most 88 base glyphs. A stable 16-cell coverage mask
fades the material override as media contribution rises; full media uses source
luminance for glyph choice. Edge direction uses source
luminance gradients and the previous glyph near a threshold. Flat
processing retains its 8-bit cell texture. Bright output is a global persisted
preference, excluded from presets and preserved by preset/WTF changes. It
starts off; opting in enables the lift. Existing saved preferences are retained.
With source colors, after saturation and before contrast/gamma, luminance L is raised to L^0.22;
RGB is scaled to that luminance, then chroma is compressed toward it only when
needed to fit the RGB gamut. This keeps hue and black/white endpoints while
lifting dark saturated colors as well as greys. For palettes, lookup remains
unchanged and the mapped RGB is lifted afterwards so cycling ranges are not
lost. Glyph luminance uses the same lift on stable base-palette luminance,
independent of the animated color. JS software, WebGL2, shared browser/native WGSL and Rust
software paths have shared golden vectors; the cell parameter block is 112
bytes, with the toggle at byte 96. The toggle updates live uniforms and clears
feedback history, without rebuilding the source or GPU resources.

Feedback uses two reusable floating-point history textures, separate from the
existing 8-bit cell output. Retention integrates elapsed time and history zoom/
rotation uses elapsed time too. WebGL2 uses two render targets; WebGPU/native
write cell output and history in the same compute pass. Image bind groups are
cached in both history directions. Canvas reuses two float arrays and one byte
output. The older WebGL2 byte fallback applies an elapsed-time quantization
correction so trails cannot become permanent. No per-frame glyph atlas or
source reconstruction is introduced.

Changing scene mode is a visual crossfade on the existing source. Native output
receives scene parameters, clock and bounded audio state; it does not need
screenshot IPC for accelerated scenes. Explicit Canvas spatial output uses the
existing mirror fallback. Native softbuffer does not silently substitute flat
media when a GPU scene cannot be presented; it reports the unavailable path.
The legacy server-stream renderer is unchanged and hides spatial controls.

Per-column geometry caching is a possible future optimization, not a claim of
this implementation. The measured cell shader is the initial baseline; keep
geometry parity fixtures and source continuity when changing traversal.
