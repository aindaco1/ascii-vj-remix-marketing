# Rendering Engine

This document describes how ASCII VJ Remix renders sources into ASCII/cell
visual output across browser and Tauri desktop contexts.

Related practice docs:

- [Performance](/docs/operations/performance/) for renderer/output latency and FPS validation.
- [Security](/docs/operations/security/) for local media, Tauri capability, updater, and
  FFmpeg sidecar boundaries.
- [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/) for the current renderer, media, native output, and
  release validation matrix.
- [Accessibility](/docs/operations/accessibility/) and [Internationalization](/docs/operations/internationalization/) for
  control-surface UX rules that affect renderer-facing controls.

## Goals

- Preserve the high-quality WebGPU/WebGL output adapted from
  `ascii-point-and-click`.
- Keep ASCILINE's fast Canvas and adaptive stream lineage available as fallback
  and development infrastructure.
- Keep normal app use local-first and offline.
- Keep all live controls routed through one canonical parameter model.
- Allow presets, WTF mode, audio reactivity, and future MIDI control to compose
  without forking renderer state.
- Keep Pop Out output as close to latency-free as possible, especially for live
  camera sources.

## High-Level Data Flow

```text
Source selection
  -> source adapter
  -> canonical params
  -> optional live modulation
  -> effective params
  -> renderer runtime
  -> main preview
  -> optional native/browser Pop Out
```

Source selection can come from built-in media, user-selected files, camera
streams, mixed cameras, or development stream sessions. The renderer runtime
chooses the best backend for the active source and environment.

## Source Layer

### Built-In Media

The visible built-ins are:

- Demo Image: `media/demo.svg`.
- Demo Video: `media/demo-video-2.mp4`.

Hidden fixtures such as `media/point-click-test.mp4` and
`media/point-click-test-30s.mp4` remain for development, parity tests, and
performance smoke tests.

### Custom Files

Browser mode uses browser file APIs and blob URLs. Tauri mode uses a native
dialog command and registers the selected file under a session-local media id.
That media id is exposed to the webview through Tauri's asset protocol.

The important security boundary is that the renderer receives a playable media
URL or registered id. It does not gain broad filesystem access.

### Cameras

Browser camera capture uses `getUserMedia`.

For a single camera:

```text
MediaDevices.getUserMedia
  -> hidden video element
  -> MediaSource abstraction
  -> WebGPU/WebGL2/Canvas renderer
```

For multiple cameras:

```text
N camera streams
  -> hidden video elements
  -> Canvas2D mixer
  -> captured/mixed media source
  -> renderer
```

Camera controls include device selection, capture size, FPS, layout, framing,
and mirror. Facing-mode controls are hidden when irrelevant to the selected
device capabilities.

Tauri native Pop Out has an additional macOS path for single-camera output:

```text
AVFoundation capture
  -> latest BGRA/RGB frame
  -> native output renderer
```

That path avoids WebView canvas readback and was introduced to reduce camera
latency.

### Audio

Audio is not a visual source. It is an analysis source that modulates render
params.

Browser audio sources:

- local audio file.
- mic/input through `getUserMedia`.
- display/tab audio through `getDisplayMedia` when the platform exposes an
  audio track.

Tauri desktop audio sources:

- browser/Web Audio providers where available.
- native system/input audio feature providers for desktop builds.

The audio layer outputs bounded feature vectors, not raw audio buffers or raw
visual frames.

### Stream Sessions

Stream sessions are development/advanced infrastructure in 0.9.0.

Legacy path:

```text
Python/FastAPI/OpenCV
  -> ASCILINE frame preparation
  -> adaptive WebSocket frames
  -> JS decoder
  -> Canvas stream runtime
```

Rust/FFmpeg path:

```text
registered media id
  -> Rust media session
  -> FFmpeg probe/decode
  -> Rust frame preparation
  -> adaptive encode
  -> Tauri batch read
  -> StreamRuntime
```

The normal Source UI hides stream mode until this workflow is ready for normal
users.

## Parameter Model

The app maintains one canonical parameter object, commonly referred to in code
as `params`.

Major parameter groups:

- source: source mode, media URL/id, media type, source name.
- camera: selected device ids, resolution, FPS, layout, framing, mirror.
- backend: auto, WebGPU, WebGL2, Canvas2D, Pixel Canvas.
- grid: columns, rows, auto rows, cell width, cell height, aspect correction.
- color: saturation, contrast, brightness, gamma, background blend,
  quantization.
- sampling: FPS, jitter amount, jitter speed, sample X/Y, smoothing.
- glyph/cell: glyph mode, solid mode, compact character set and font family
  menus, minimum glyph intensity.
- stream: codec, quality, tolerance, buffer settings, frame timing.
- UI/performance: stats overlay, transition seconds.

The control surface, presets, persistence, source changes, WTF mode, audio
reactivity, native output, and future MIDI all read from or write through this
model.

Static renderer-family transitions keep media ownership at the `StaticRuntime`
layer. Canvas2D, pixel Canvas, WebGL, and WebGPU renderers can crossfade over
the same live video/camera source instead of destroying and reloading media when
`solidMode`, `glyphMode`, `pixel`, or `backend` changes.

### Shared Renderer Math

Version 0.9.2 starts reducing duplicated renderer math without changing visible
Canvas or stream output.

Shared JavaScript helpers live in:

```text
renderers/shared/render-math.js
renderers/shared/render-math-vectors.json
```

The shared module currently owns:

- GPU-style color processing used by software snapshots and native parity tests.
- Legacy Canvas color processing.
- Legacy stream color processing.
- shader-style jitter hash helpers.
- compact charset and luminance-to-glyph helpers.

The legacy Canvas and stream functions are intentionally named separately from
the GPU function. Canvas/stream quantization and background-blend behavior are
preserved in 0.9.2 so this release does not introduce visual regressions while
the shader/math contract is being consolidated.

`npm run test:render-math` validates the JavaScript helpers against shared
vectors. Rust native output tests consume the same vector file for GPU color
processing parity.

### Effective Params

Some features should affect live rendering without changing saved state.

Audio reactivity is the main example:

```text
base params
  + audio feature modulation
  -> effective params
  -> renderer.updateParams()
```

Effective params must not persist back into user presets unless the user
explicitly saves the current state as a preset.

## Backend Selection

Backend `auto` attempts the highest-quality viable path first.

Typical browser priority:

1. WebGPU.
2. WebGL2.
3. Canvas2D.
4. Pixel Canvas when selected or required.

The user can override the backend manually. Controls that do not apply to the
active backend are hidden or disabled.

## WebGPU Renderer

The WebGPU renderer is the primary quality target.

Video sources use `importExternalTexture()` per frame. Image sources upload once
with `copyExternalImageToTexture()` into a `texture_2d<f32>`.

The renderer uses a two-stage GPU flow:

1. Cell pass:
   - divide the source into a grid.
   - sample one point per cell.
   - apply animated per-cell jitter.
   - optionally mirror X.
   - apply color processing.
   - write one processed color per cell to a storage texture.
2. Render pass:
   - draw a fullscreen triangle.
   - map output pixels to cells using cell width/height.
   - fetch the processed cell color.
   - fill the output canvas.

Color processing includes:

- saturation boost around luminance average.
- contrast boost around midpoint.
- brightness.
- gamma.
- optional color quantization.
- background blend toward the app's dark canvas color.

Jitter uses a deterministic hash seeded by cell position and time, so static
images can animate without changing source media.

## WebGL2 Renderer

The WebGL2 backend mirrors the WebGPU visual model as closely as practical:

- video frames upload with `texImage2D()` per frame.
- images upload once.
- first pass samples one color per cell into a cell-color texture.
- second pass expands the cell-color texture to the visible canvas.
- shader uniforms match the WebGPU parameter set where possible.

WebGL2 is the most important browser fallback because it is widely available on
machines that do not expose WebGPU.

## Canvas Renderers

Canvas paths preserve ASCILINE compatibility and low-level fallback behavior.

Canvas2D glyph/text mode renders character-like cells. Pixel Canvas renders
colored block/pixel data more directly.

These paths are important for:

- older browsers or webviews.
- stream-frame compatibility.
- testing the adaptive codec output.
- environments where GPU initialization fails.

Canvas fallback should remain functional even when it is not the highest-quality
path.

## Static Runtime

`StaticRuntime` manages browser-native local sources and GPU/Canvas backends.

Responsibilities:

- load or rebuild the active source.
- choose backend.
- start and stop media playback.
- keep the renderer alive across live-safe param changes.
- rebuild renderer surfaces when structural params change.
- preserve video playback state when changing presets that do not change the
  source.
- update stats.

For structural changes, the runtime uses layered renderer surfaces:

```text
old renderer stays visible
  -> new renderer initializes behind or beside it
  -> non-structural params tween
  -> surfaces crossfade
  -> old renderer is destroyed
```

This avoids black frames during preset transitions.

## Stream Runtime

`StreamRuntime` handles ASCILINE-style encoded frame streams.

It can consume:

- WebSocket frames from the legacy Python/FastAPI server.
- native Rust/FFmpeg session batches in Tauri development paths.

Stream frames carry INIT metadata and framebuffer messages. The JS decoder
supports:

- legacy raw frames.
- adaptive RAW.
- adaptive ZLIB.
- adaptive DELTA.

Stream mode remains hidden from the normal Source UI in 0.9.0. It is retained
for development and future productization.

## Adaptive Codec

The adaptive codec exists to reduce bandwidth compared with sending the full
framebuffer every frame.

Each encoded frame chooses one of:

- RAW: full framebuffer.
- ZLIB: compressed framebuffer.
- DELTA: cells changed since the previous frame.

Codec quality can allow tolerance-based temporal deltas for color planes while
keeping character planes exact where applicable.

Compatibility rules:

- existing legacy clients can still receive raw frames.
- JS and Rust decoders must stay compatible with Python-generated vectors.
- codec changes require vector tests.

## Rust/FFmpeg Media Pipeline

The Rust/FFmpeg path ports the Python/FastAPI stream preparation path toward a
desktop-packaged local engine.

Current shape:

```text
Tauri selected media
  -> Rust registry id
  -> ffprobe metadata
  -> ffmpeg RGB frame reader
  -> frame preparation
  -> adaptive encoder
  -> native session batches
  -> StreamRuntime or validation tools
```

Key modules:

- `media_engine::ffmpeg`: FFmpeg/ffprobe process boundary, video probe, RGB
  reader, camera reader options.
- `media_engine::frame_prep`: ASCILINE-compatible text/color/pixel framebuffer
  preparation.
- `media_engine::codec`: adaptive codec encoder/decoder.
- `media_engine::pipeline`: decode -> prep -> encode -> optional decode
  verification.

Frame preparation modes:

- text mode: grayscale to ASCII palette.
- color modes 2 through 5: `[char, R, G, B]` cells with quantized color levels.
- pixel mode: `[B, G, R]` cells.

The Rust path is not intended to replace the WebGPU/WebGL static renderer. It is
the long-term answer for packaged stream-style media preparation and broader
native decode support.

## Native Output Renderer

The native output renderer exists because a second WebView-rendered pop-out was
too expensive for low-latency live output.

Desktop flow:

```text
main UI params/source state
  -> Tauri native output command
  -> native output state
  -> source frame acquisition
  -> native `wgpu` presenter
  -> output window
```

For file-backed images/videos, Rust resolves bundled resources or registered
media ids, decodes frames, uploads the latest frame to the GPU, applies cell
color math, and presents through the native swapchain.

For macOS single-camera output, AVFoundation captures latest frames directly for
the native presenter. Live camera presets should not use browser mirror
transport by default because canvas readback and IPC frame transfer are too
expensive for sustained output.

For Canvas2D-style glyph presets, native output consumes the same canonical
`glyphMode` and `charset` params as the control surface. The native `wgpu`
presenter uses a bundled fixed bitmap glyph atlas and luminance ramp so
traditional ASCII presets stay text-like in Pop Out instead of becoming solid
color cells. WebGL/WebGPU-style presets disable native glyph masking even when
their saved params still carry `glyphMode`; their main preview renders solid
GPU cell rectangles, so Pop Out does the same.
`fontFamily` remains a preview/control-surface parameter; the native path does
not load arbitrary fonts and instead masks cells through the fixed atlas/ramp.

For fallback/mirrored sources, bounded raw pixel snapshots can be sent from the
main renderer to the native output.

Native output design rules:

- output window should not own broad Tauri permissions.
- presenter should consume latest params live.
- latest-frame semantics are preferred over deep buffering.
- primary renderer behavior must not regress when Pop Out is open.
- browser fallback must remain available.

## Audio-Reactive Modulation

Audio analysis updates effective render params at frame rate.

Features:

- RMS.
- bass.
- low-mid.
- mid.
- high-mid.
- treble.
- presence.
- brightness.
- density.
- spectral flux.
- beat pulse.
- phase/sway.

Dense-mix dampening uses the density feature to reduce beat/flux-heavy
modulation during crowded broadband passages without muting sparse transients.

Modulation targets are live-safe visual controls:

- brightness.
- contrast.
- saturation.
- gamma.
- background blend.
- jitter amount.
- jitter speed.
- sample offsets.

Structural controls such as source, backend, grid allocation, and camera devices
are not modulated per beat because they would cause renderer churn.

## Presets, WTF Mode, and Future MIDI

These are all control layers over the same parameter model.

Presets:

- apply known parameter sets.
- may specify transition duration.
- can be saved/imported/exported by users.

WTF mode:

- creates randomized target params.
- anchors some random states around extreme preset families and traditional
  ASCII presets.
- transitions indefinitely until stopped.
- avoids unsafe all-white/all-black states.

Future MIDI:

- should use a shared control target registry.
- should call the same setters as visible UI controls.
- should respect live-safe vs structural target metadata.
- should not fork renderer state.

## Packaging and Offline Runtime

The renderer must not depend on online assets at runtime.

Packaged assets include:

- frontend bundle.
- renderer code.
- GPU assets.
- fonts.
- built-in demo media.
- Tauri native code.
- future reviewed FFmpeg sidecars.

Production CSP blocks arbitrary remote HTTP(S) runtime access. The asset
protocol is scoped narrowly and session-locally for user-selected media.

## Testing Strategy

Renderer-related tests should cover:

- static source startup.
- source switching.
- camera source and fake-device paths.
- preset application.
- transition smoothness.
- WebGL2 and Canvas fallbacks.
- output display placement.
- native output performance and log analysis.
- adaptive codec vectors.
- Rust/Python frame-prep parity.
- FFmpeg/OpenCV decode/resize bounded parity.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run smoke:static
npm run test:output-display
npm run smoke:native-output
npm run smoke:ui-perf
npm run test:vectors
npm run test:frame-prep
npm run test:decode-resize
npm run check:media
npm run test:rust
```

## Open Engineering Work

- Consolidate duplicated color math across WebGPU, WebGL2, Canvas, stream, and
  native output.
- Add more direct texture-sharing camera paths:
  - AVFoundation/CVPixelBuffer/Metal on macOS.
  - Media Foundation/D3D on Windows.
  - PipeWire/V4L2/Vulkan or GLES on Linux.
- Productize stream mode or keep it hidden.
- Add MIDI control registry and native MIDI adapter.
- Improve native system audio capture through narrower platform APIs.
- Add performance tests that reproduce user-reported Pop Out/main-window
  contention automatically.
