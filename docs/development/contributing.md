# Contributing

This guide is for people who want to build, test, document, or extend ASCII VJ
Remix.

The project is a local-first native Tauri renderer lab. Treat that as a
constraint when contributing: avoid online runtime dependencies, keep broad
filesystem access out of the app, and preserve renderer quality whenever a
desktop-only feature is added.

## Repository Map

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js` | Main renderer lab UI and control logic. |
| `renderers/gpu/` | Vendored/adapted GPU renderer, media source abstraction, WebGPU/WebGL2 backends, and renderer assets. |
| `renderers/desktop/` | Tauri adapter and output-display helpers. |
| `src-tauri/` | Tauri v2 desktop shell, native output window, media registry, audio providers, FFmpeg media engine, capabilities, icons, and packaging config. |
| `media/` | Built-in demo image/video and hidden development fixtures. |
| `experiments/` | Legacy/adaptive codec vector and stream experiments. |
| `scripts/` | Build checks, Podman setup, release helpers, updater helpers, FFmpeg staging/build scripts, and smoke tests. |
| `docs/` | Roadmap, rendering-engine guide, security, performance, testing, accessibility, i18n, LLM agent guide, and contributor documentation. |

## Prerequisites

Minimum development tools:

- Node.js 24 or newer.
- npm.
- Rust stable toolchain with Cargo.
- Git.
- A current browser. Chromium is preferred for WebGPU testing.

Platform-specific desktop prerequisites:

- macOS: Xcode command line tools.
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ workload and WebView2
  runtime.
- Linux: WebKitGTK 4.1 development packages, appindicator, ALSA development
  headers, librsvg, OpenSSL, patchelf, and build tools.

Optional but useful:

- Podman for the reproducible Linux dev shell and Python/OpenCV experiments.
- FFmpeg/ffprobe for media-engine development.
- Playwright dependencies for browser smoke tests.
- GitHub CLI for release secret management.

## First-Time Setup

Install JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Run the browser dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8010/
```

Run the static smoke test:

```bash
npm run smoke:static
```

Run the desktop app in development mode:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

Run the main desktop validation gate:

```bash
npm run check:desktop
```

On macOS workspaces stored under iCloud Drive, the Tauri build helper redirects
target output to `/private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-tauri-target` so iCloud extended
attributes do not break app signing. You can override the build directory with
`ASCILINE_TAURI_TARGET_DIR` or `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.

## Common Commands

| Command | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Browser dev server on `127.0.0.1:8010`. |
| `npm run build` | Vite production build plus runtime asset copy. |
| `npm run preview` | Preview the production build. |
| `npm run check:offline` | Build and verify no remote runtime assets are required. |
| `npm run smoke:static` | Browser smoke test for source UI, renderer startup, output fallback, and audio fake devices. |
| `npm run tauri:dev` | Tauri desktop dev mode. |
| `npm run check:desktop` | Offline build, Tauri policy, output-display simulation, updater manifest, FFmpeg resource policy, Rust tests, and debug no-bundle build. |
| `npm run bundle:debug` | Build a local debug desktop bundle and validate it. |
| `npm run bundle:release` | Run release gates, build release bundle, and validate it. |
| `npm run test:rust` | Run Rust tests. |
| `npm run check:media` | Run frame prep, decode/resize, and native session media checks. |
| `npm run test:output-display` | Deterministic secondary-display placement simulation. |
| `npm run smoke:native-output` | Native output performance smoke helper. |
| `npm run smoke:ui-perf` | UI performance smoke helper. |

## Podman Development Shell

The repo includes a Podman setup for a reproducible Linux environment on macOS
and Linux. It is especially useful for Python/OpenCV codec experiments and for
avoiding host Python/OpenSSL differences.

```bash
scripts/podman-doctor.sh
scripts/podman_build.sh
scripts/podman_venv.sh
scripts/podman_run.sh bash
```

The Podman image defaults to Node 24. To smoke-test a newer even-numbered Node
release:

```bash
NODE_MAJOR=26 scripts/podman_build.sh
```

Run the legacy codec/vector suite through Podman:

```bash
scripts/podman_codec_tests.sh
```

For long-running commands, the Podman wrapper can restart unexpected exits:

```bash
PORT=8010 ASCILINE_RESTART=1 scripts/podman_run.sh python -m http.server 8010 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

If a port is already in use, pick another host port:

```bash
HOST_PORT=8011 CONTAINER_PORT=8010 ASCILINE_RESTART=1 scripts/podman_run.sh python -m http.server 8010 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

## Development Rules

- Keep runtime behavior local-first. Do not add CDNs, online decoders, hosted
  fonts, analytics, remote provider SDKs, or runtime codec downloads.
- Keep user-selected files behind explicit user selection.
- Do not add broad home-directory or filesystem grants.
- Keep the normal Source UI focused on static local sources until stream mode is
  fully productized.
- Preserve the Vite/static smoke harness and renderer portability when adding
  desktop-only Tauri features.
- Keep stats overlay user-controlled. Randomization, presets, and audio
  reactivity should not silently turn it off.
- Avoid renderer restarts when switching presets, audio settings, or live-safe
  controls.
- Run appropriate checks before opening a PR.

Use the project practice docs when changing shared behavior:

- [Security](/docs/operations/security/): Tauri capabilities, local media, permissions,
  updater signing, FFmpeg sidecars, and secret handling.
- [Performance](/docs/operations/performance/): renderer FPS, native Pop Out, source switching,
  camera latency, audio response, and optimized-build validation.
- [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/): check selection, smoke coverage, release checks, and
  manual hardware validation.
- [Accessibility](/docs/operations/accessibility/): keyboard, focus, labels, contrast, and
  dense-control best practices.
- [Internationalization](/docs/operations/internationalization/): future bundled translation catalog and string
  ownership rules.

## Frontend and Renderer Work

The app uses vanilla HTML/CSS/ES modules with Vite. There is no React/Svelte
application layer.

Important state concepts:

- `params`: canonical persisted renderer state.
- `effectiveParams`: live render state after audio reactivity or other
  non-persistent modulation.
- `SOURCE_PRESETS`: visible built-in sources.
- `BUILTIN_PRESETS`: read-only preset library.
- `StaticRuntime`: browser media source plus WebGPU/WebGL2/Canvas renderer.
- `StreamRuntime`: legacy/dev stream path.
- `AudioReactiveRuntime`: local audio analysis and effective-param modulation.

When adding a visible control:

1. Add it to the canonical parameter model.
2. Add control metadata.
3. Add conditional visibility rules if it is not valid for every source/backend.
4. Route changes through the same setter path as sliders, presets, WTF mode, and
   future MIDI.
5. Verify it works live without restarting media unless it is explicitly a
   structural renderer/source change.

## Desktop and Tauri Work

Tauri commands are declared in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and gated through
capabilities in `src-tauri/capabilities/`.

Keep capabilities narrow:

- Main window: media selection, output management, audio providers, updater.
- Output window: minimal listen/close/fullscreen permissions only.

The production CSP in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` intentionally blocks
arbitrary remote HTTP(S) connections. If you need a new protocol or resource
path, update the policy deliberately and run:

```bash
npm run check:tauri-policy
```

## macOS Permissions During Development

The app uses bundle identifier:

```text
com.asciline.remix
```

Reset local privacy grants when needed:

```bash
tccutil reset Camera com.asciline.remix
tccutil reset Microphone com.asciline.remix
tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.asciline.remix
tccutil reset AudioCapture com.asciline.remix
```

For stable local media permissions across rebuilds, create a local code-signing
identity once:

```bash
npm run desktop:codesign:local
```

Then run:

```bash
ASCILINE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="ASCII VJ Remix Local Code Signing" npm run desktop:run-local
```

Without a stable identity, macOS may treat rebuilds as a different app for
privacy purposes.

## FFmpeg and Media Engine Work

The project is moving long-term stream/media preparation toward a Rust/FFmpeg
pipeline instead of bundling Python in production.

Development commands use these environment variables when set:

```bash
ASCILINE_FFMPEG=/path/to/ffmpeg
ASCILINE_FFPROBE=/path/to/ffprobe
```

Preview the media pipeline:

```bash
npm run media:decode-preview -- media/point-click-test.mp4 96 54 2
npm run media:pipeline-preview -- media/point-click-test.mp4 96 54 12 5 false
npm run media:native-session-preview -- media/point-click-test.mp4 96 54 12 5 true 4
```

Run parity checks:

```bash
npm run test:frame-prep
npm run test:decode-resize
npm run check:media
```

Release builds should use reviewed FFmpeg/ffprobe sidecars. Stage binaries with
explicit provenance:

```bash
npm run ffmpeg:stage -- --ffmpeg /path/to/ffmpeg --ffprobe /path/to/ffprobe --license LGPL-2.1-or-later --source "reviewed reproducible build notes"
npm run check:ffmpeg-resources
```

The release workflow builds FFmpeg from the pinned official 8.1.2 source
tarball with network protocols disabled and stages LGPL-compatible sidecars.
Do not commit generated sidecar binaries or private release keys.

## Release and Updater Work

ASCII VJ Remix desktop builds must remain standalone at runtime. The only
intentional online path is the Tauri updater, which checks GitHub release
metadata when the app invokes the updater plugin.

Releases are published by `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`. The release
matrix builds macOS, Windows, and Linux artifacts, verifies them, writes updater
manifest fragments, merges those fragments into `latest.json`, and uploads
installers, updater packages, signatures, and `latest.json` to GitHub Releases.
The workflow builds from the requested `v*` tag so release artifacts match the
tagged source, not whatever happens to be at `main` later.

`.github/workflows/auto-version-release.yml` automates the common release path.
When `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`,
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, or `CHANGELOG.md` changes on `main`, it validates
that the app versions match with `npm run release:version:check`, creates
`vX.Y.Z` when that tag does not already exist, and dispatches the desktop
release workflow with that tag. If the tag already exists, it skips release
dispatch so repeated pushes do not overwrite a published version accidentally.

The GitHub Releases updater reads:

```text
https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/releases/latest/download/latest.json
```

Updater packages are signed with a minisign key pair. The public key is
committed in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. The private key must be stored as the
GitHub Actions secret `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`; never commit it.
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` is required for the current encrypted
release key.

The current public key was generated with a password-protected key:

```bash
npm run tauri -- signer generate --ci -w /private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.key -p "$(cat /private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.password)"
```

For this local workspace, the generated private key is expected at
`/private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.key` and the password is expected at
`/private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.password`. Never commit either file.

Set/check the updater key with GitHub CLI:

```bash
npm run updater:secret:check
npm run updater:secret:set
npm run release:secrets:check
npm run release:secrets:check:public
```

The updater secret script passes values to `gh secret set` over stdin, not as
command-line arguments. Use `-- --repo owner/repo` or `-- --key /path/to/key`
after the npm script if the defaults are wrong.

For 0.9.3, `release:secrets:check:public` requires updater signing and macOS
Developer ID notarization readiness. Windows artifacts are published as unsigned
previews and do not require Windows signing secrets.

For a local debug bundle with the generated updater key:

```bash
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat /private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.key)" TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD="$(cat /private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.password)" npm run bundle:debug
```

Current macOS local/default builds are ad-hoc signed by
`bundle.macOS.signingIdentity = "-"` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. That keeps
local bundles code-sign-valid but is not Apple notarization. Public macOS
release builds use `src-tauri/tauri.notarized.conf.json` and fail if Developer
ID signing and notarization credentials are missing.

Local macOS media privacy grants can be sensitive to the final app signature.
`scripts/run_local_desktop_app.sh` accepts
`ASCILINE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="<identity>"` so local test builds can be re-signed
with a stable local/self-signed identity instead of a changing ad-hoc signature:

```bash
npm run desktop:codesign:local
ASCILINE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="ASCII VJ Remix Local Code Signing" npm run desktop:run-local
```

Developer ID signing and notarization require Apple Developer Program
membership, a base64 Developer ID Application `.p12`, its password, a CI
keychain password, and either App Store Connect API credentials or Apple ID
notarization credentials. Check readiness or upload App Store Connect API
credentials with:

```bash
npm run release:secrets:check:notarized
npm run release:secrets:set:macos -- \
  --certificate /path/to/developer-id-application.p12 \
  --certificate-password-file /path/to/p12-password.txt \
  --api-key ABCDE12345 \
  --api-issuer 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
  --api-key-file /path/to/AuthKey_ABCDE12345.p8
```

Apple ID credentials are also supported:

```bash
npm run release:secrets:set:macos -- \
  --certificate /path/to/developer-id-application.p12 \
  --certificate-password-file /path/to/p12-password.txt \
  --apple-id-file /path/to/apple-id-email.txt \
  --apple-password-file /path/to/app-specific-password.txt \
  --apple-team-id TEAMID12345
```

When `--keychain-password-file` is omitted, the script generates a random
temporary keychain password and stores it in `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`.

Future signed Windows releases can use Azure Artifact Signing through
`src-tauri/tauri.windows-signed.conf.json`, which invokes
`src-tauri/windows-artifact-sign.cmd`; that wrapper calls
`scripts/windows_artifact_sign.ps1`. This signs Windows artifacts before Tauri
creates updater signatures. The active 0.9.3 Windows release path does not use
this config and publishes unsigned preview artifacts. Configure the Azure values
only if Azure becomes the chosen Windows signing backend:

```bash
npm run release:secrets:set:windows -- \
  --client-id "<app-client-id>" \
  --tenant-id "<tenant-id>" \
  --client-secret-file /path/to/azure-client-secret.txt \
  --endpoint "https://<region>.codesigning.azure.net/" \
  --account "<signing-account-name>" \
  --certificate-profile "<certificate-profile-name>"
node scripts/check_github_release_secrets.mjs --require-windows-signing
```

The helper stores `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` as a GitHub Actions secret and the other
Azure IDs as GitHub repository variables. The Azure client secret is the only
required Windows signing secret; keep it out of shell history and chat logs.
Prefer the future SignPath Foundation/license-cleanup track before enabling paid
Azure signing for routine public releases.

Use these checks before publishing release changes:

```bash
npm run check:desktop
npm run test:updater-manifest
npm run check:bundle:debug
```

On this macOS iCloud Drive workspace, Tauri build output is redirected to
`/private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-tauri-target` to avoid iCloud extended attributes
breaking `codesign`. Normal CI and non-iCloud workspaces continue to use
`src-tauri/target`. Override with `ASCILINE_TAURI_TARGET_DIR` or
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` when needed.

Release builds run `npm run ffmpeg:build-sidecar` before
`npm run check:release`. That builds from the pinned official FFmpeg 8.1.2
source tarball, verifies the source SHA-256, disables FFmpeg network protocols,
and stages LGPL-compatible FFmpeg/ffprobe binaries as local Tauri resources.
Runtime builds remain offline; CI may download official source during release
builds, but the packaged app never downloads FFmpeg, codecs, or renderer assets
at runtime.

The release workflow also runs `scripts/smoke_tauri_release_install.mjs` after
publishing. It downloads artifacts from GitHub Releases instead of reusing local
build directories, catching missing assets, bad `latest.json` URLs, installer
layout issues, and broken signed updater downloads. CI-only smoke hooks are
inactive unless these environment variables are set:

The updater-hop smoke defaults to `ASCILINE_UPDATER_SMOKE_MIN_VERSION=0.9.0`.
Older `0.1.x` releases used an incompatible updater signing key, so they can be
kept as historical releases but cannot be used as a cryptographic updater-hop
baseline for the current app line.

- `ASCILINE_DESKTOP_SMOKE=launch`: bounded launch smoke with a report.
- `ASCILINE_UPDATER_SMOKE=download`: checks `latest.json`, downloads the signed
  updater package, verifies its signature, writes a report, and exits.
- `ASCILINE_UPDATER_SMOKE=install`: downloads and verifies the updater package,
  writes a pre-install report, and invokes Tauri's installer path.
- `ASCILINE_UPDATER_SMOKE_FORCE_FROM_VERSION`: records the forced older-version
  hop used by CI.

The true app-driven updater hop needs a previous release that already contains
`ASCILINE_UPDATER_SMOKE=install`. Releases before v0.1.5 can only participate in
direct install and updater download smoke.
