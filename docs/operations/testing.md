# Testing

This guide documents the current automated checks, manual verification paths,
and known coverage gaps for ASCII VJ Remix.

Testing focuses on offline bundles, renderer startup, source switching,
native output, media/camera/audio behavior, Tauri permissions, FFmpeg sidecars,
release artifacts, and updater manifests.

## Recommended Check Sets

### Documentation Only

```bash
git diff --check
```

### Frontend UI, CSS, Presets, Sources, Audio UI

```bash
npm run build
npm run smoke:static
```

Add manual checks for source switching, preset transitions, WTF mode, and audio
reactivity when behavior changes.

### Renderer Backend Changes

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:render-math
npm run smoke:static
npm run check:media
```

Also manually compare WebGPU and WebGL2 output for representative presets.

### Native Output or Pop Out Changes

```bash
npm run test:output-display
npm run smoke:native-output
npm run test:native-output-log
npm run test:rust
```

Use an optimized app build before making performance conclusions.
The UI performance smoke starts from canonical visual defaults, uses fixed
non-structural numeric transitions, and records each backend visited so repeat
runs are comparable. Select an exact bundle and a longer sample with:

```bash
ASCILINE_SOURCE_APP="/absolute/path/ASCII VJ Remix.app" \
ASCILINE_UI_PERF_SMOKE_DURATION_MS=30000 \
npm run smoke:ui-perf
```

Native log analysis reports both source upload and upload-skip rates. A healthy
24 FPS source on a 60 Hz display uploads near source rate and skips
the duplicate display ticks while presentation remains near refresh rate.
For glyph-mode changes, include at least one traditional ASCII preset in manual
Pop Out checks and confirm Character Set/Font Family changes do not hide the
Glyph/Cell controls.

### MIDI, UC-33e, or SysEx Changes

```bash
npm run test:midi
npm run check:tauri-policy
npm run test:rust
npm run midi:probe -- --connect
npm run smoke:static
```

The physical probe verifies that CoreMIDI can enumerate and simultaneously open
both directions of the mioXC. It does not replace the control sweep and
full-bank capture/restore checklist in [MIDI_UC33E](https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/blob/main/docs/MIDI_UC33E.md).

### Tauri Commands, Permissions, or Capabilities

```bash
npm run check:tauri-policy
npm run test:crash-relay
npm run test:rust
npm run check:desktop
```

Manually verify macOS Camera, Microphone, Screen/System Audio, and Pop Out
behavior when the permission model changes.

For crash-report changes, also verify that debug builds capture locally but do
not submit, release builds use only `https://crash.dustwave.xyz/v1/reports`, and
the output window has no crash-report permissions. The Reports control stays
visible with an empty queue, and local media diagnostics are never submitted.

### FFmpeg and Media Engine

```bash
npm run test:ffmpeg-policy
npm run check:ffmpeg-resources
npm run check:media
npm run test:rust
```

For release sidecars:

```bash
npm run test:ffmpeg-source-build
npm run check:ffmpeg-release
```

### Release and Updater

```bash
npm run test:desktop-updater
npm run check:release
npm run bundle:release
npm run smoke:release-install
npm run test:macos-dmg-layout
```

Run `npm run ffmpeg:build-sidecar` before `npm run check:release` on a clean
clone. `npm run bundle:release` runs the sidecar build step automatically.

The release smoke downloads artifacts from GitHub Releases and checks installer
layout, bundled assets, signed updater packages, `latest.json` behavior, the
visible packaged Update and Reports controls, and the absence of a duplicate
top-bar backend readout. On
macOS it verifies the downloaded DMG, mounts it read-only in a private temporary
root, validates the exact app-to-Applications layout, and inspects the mounted
app before the updater hop.

If artifact publication succeeds but a post-publication runner exposes an
acceptance-tooling defect, run the `Release Acceptance` workflow against the
existing immutable tag after correcting the tooling. It reuses the published
bytes and does not rebuild or replace release assets.
Updater-hop smoke uses `0.9.0` as the default minimum previous version because
older `0.1.x` releases were signed with a different updater key.

The controller test verifies that production availability permits exactly one
silent check per launch, current/offline results do not announce status, an
available update is not installed automatically, and the existing manual path
still performs rechecks and user-triggered installation.

Versions 0.9.6 and 0.9.7 shipped without the main-window app-name capability
used by the updater availability gate, so their Update control can flash and
then disappear. Install 0.9.8 manually from the notarized DMG. Relaunch 0.9.8
and confirm the current-version launch check stays silent while the Update
control remains visible, then use the control and confirm it reports `Up to
date`. For the 0.9.9 release, launch the installed 0.9.8 app and confirm its
background check surfaces 0.9.9 without downloading it automatically. After the
user-approved install, confirm Reports remains visible with an empty queue and
the right-side backend readout is absent.

On macOS, release smoke extracts the current and previous `.app.tar.gz`
payloads, requires `com.asciline.remix`, Team ID `PWT3Q52LZ2`, hardened runtime,
Gatekeeper acceptance, and the exact same designated requirement, then runs the
previous app through the updater and revalidates the replaced bundle. The
interactive TCC approval itself remains a manual check.

## Manual Smoke Checklist

Use this after user-facing renderer, source, audio, or output changes:

1. Launch the desktop app.
2. Confirm Demo Image appears and renderer starts automatically.
3. Switch to Demo Video and confirm playback starts.
4. Switch back to Demo Image and confirm the renderer does not get stuck.
5. Select Camera and confirm permission prompt/device behavior.
6. Select Mic/Input and confirm Audio Reactivity starts or requests permission.
7. Switch audio devices and confirm capture restarts automatically.
8. Trigger Display/System Audio where supported and confirm errors are useful
   when the selected source has no audio track.
9. Click several presets and confirm smooth transitions.
10. Select a traditional ASCII preset and confirm Character Set and Font Family
    remain compact and visible.
11. Toggle WTF mode on and off and confirm it remains responsive and can visit
    traditional ASCII-looking states.
12. Open Pop Out and confirm the main preview stays responsive.
13. Confirm Pop Out reflects presets, WTF mode, and audio reactivity while fully
    visible.
14. Confirm Stats Overlay reports the active preset/source/backend/grid/FPS.
15. Close Pop Out and confirm CPU/GPU usage settles.

## Hardware and Platform Checks

The app depends on real hardware and OS media stacks. Automated tests do not
cover every hardware and platform combination.

Important manual matrices:

- macOS Apple Silicon with built-in camera and external display.
- macOS with external USB camera.
- macOS with system audio capture.
- Windows with WebView2, D3D12/WebGL2, camera, mic, and installer path.
- Linux with WebKitGTK, GPU acceleration, camera, mic, and AppImage/deb path.
- Experimental macOS Apple Silicon MIDI rig: Evolution/M-Audio UC-33e through
  both DIN directions of an iConnectivity mioXC, powered separately.

When reporting hardware results, include:

- OS version.
- CPU/GPU.
- app version and build type.
- source type.
- backend.
- Pop Out state.
- audio source.
- camera device names and requested resolution/FPS.

## Podman Checks

Podman is mainly for a reproducible Linux-like dev shell and legacy
Python/OpenCV/vector work. It is not the production runtime.

Useful commands:

```bash
scripts/podman-doctor.sh
scripts/podman_build.sh
scripts/podman_venv.sh
scripts/podman_codec_tests.sh
```

The Podman image defaults to Node 24. Use `NODE_MAJOR=26` only when explicitly
testing a newer Node baseline.

## CI and Release Behavior

Release CI:

- require a successful `Desktop` main-push run for the exact release commit.
- compile the app and build FFmpeg concurrently on macOS, Windows, and Linux,
  then verify and reuse those exact inputs for bundle-only packaging.
- verify offline bundle behavior.
- verify Tauri policy.
- build/check FFmpeg sidecars.
- run Rust and media tests.
- generate updater manifest fragments.
- merge fragments into `latest.json`.
- upload installers, updater packages, signatures, and `latest.json`.
- validate macOS Developer ID signing, notarization, stapling, and Gatekeeper
  acceptance before publishing macOS artifacts.
- publishes Windows 0.9.9 artifacts as unsigned previews; the inactive signed
  Windows path includes Authenticode signer and timestamp validation.
- run install and visible-updater-UI smoke checks after publishing.
- run macOS updater identity/replacement smoke on `macos-26`.

## Known Gaps

- No comprehensive automated accessibility suite.
- No full i18n/l10n test suite.
- No golden visual output suite for presets.
- No automated camera latency benchmark.
- Experimental MIDI parsing, mapping, fake events, and SysEx assembly are
  automated; physical control sweeps and full-bank restore still require the
  UC-33e/mioXC rig.
- Linux native media/camera/audio coverage is limited outside CI.

Prospective release, platform, accessibility, localization, and performance
coverage is tracked in the [Roadmap](/docs/reference/roadmap/).
