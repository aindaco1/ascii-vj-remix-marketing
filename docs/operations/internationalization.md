# Internationalization

This guide establishes internationalization and localization practices for
ASCII VJ Remix.

Localization work here should focus on bundled app strings, Tauri
metadata, permission descriptions, installer text, docs, and future preset/MIDI
profile UX.

## Current Baseline

Current state:

- English is the only supported app language.
- There is no formal translation catalog yet.
- Most UI strings are currently in `index.html`, `app.js`, and related
  frontend modules.
- Tauri app metadata and macOS usage strings are English.
- Documentation is English.
- User-authored preset names and custom file names are displayed as authored.

This is acceptable for 0.9.0, but future UI work should avoid making
localization harder.

## Principles

- Keep translations bundled locally. Do not use online translation services at
  runtime.
- Keep stable internal ids separate from display strings.
- Treat English as the canonical source language until a translation workflow
  exists.
- Do not localize user media paths, file names, custom preset names, or hardware
  device names.
- Localize labels, help text, status messages, errors, menus, installer copy,
  permission usage strings, and docs when a locale is supported.
- Keep units and numeric formatting locale-aware where practical.
- Keep accessibility labels localized with visible labels.

## Future Catalog Model

When localization begins, prefer a small bundled catalog structure such as:

```text
src/i18n/
  en.json
  es.json
```

or an equivalent app-owned module structure. The important constraints are:

- catalogs ship inside the app bundle.
- missing keys fall back to English.
- keys are stable and descriptive.
- visible copy is not duplicated across `index.html`, `app.js`, and Tauri
  dialogs.
- tests can check for missing keys and stale keys.

Do not add a remote CMS, CDN-hosted catalog, or network translation dependency.

## String Ownership

| String Type | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App control labels | Future bundled catalog | Source, Presets, Grid, Color, Sampling, Audio, Output. |
| Status/error messages | Future bundled catalog | Include permission, media, backend, updater, and source errors. |
| Preset ids | Code/data | Stable, not localized. |
| Built-in preset display names | Future bundled catalog | Display name can localize while id stays stable. |
| User preset names | User data | Display exactly as authored. |
| Device names | OS/hardware | Display as provided by platform. |
| File names | OS/user data | Display as provided by platform. |
| Tauri metadata | Tauri config/resources | Product name stays `ASCII VJ Remix`; installer text can localize later. |
| macOS usage strings | `src-tauri/Info.plist` | Must stay accurate in every shipped locale. |
| Documentation | Markdown docs | Translate only when there is a maintenance path. |

## UI Rules

When adding or changing user-visible text:

- Avoid building sentences by concatenating fragments.
- Keep pluralization and units separable.
- Avoid hard-coded date/time/number formatting.
- Leave room for longer translated strings in compact panels.
- Do not encode semantics only in preset names or color labels.
- Keep labels close to controls so translated text remains understandable.
- Avoid text baked into images.
- Keep keyboard shortcuts and MIDI labels separate from translated prose.

## Numbers, Units, and Formats

Current controls use values such as:

- seconds.
- FPS.
- columns/rows.
- width/height.
- percentages or normalized slider values.
- device names.
- file names.

Future localization should:

- format decimals consistently.
- preserve technical units such as FPS where expected.
- avoid translating file extensions, backend ids, codec names, or device names.
- use locale-aware number formatting for displayed values where it does not
  create noisy UI churn.

## Presets, WTF, Audio, and MIDI

Visual preset data should keep stable ids.

Future localization rules:

- Built-in preset display names may localize.
- Built-in preset ids must not localize.
- User preset names must remain user-authored.
- Imported preset packs should declare their language only for display metadata.
- MIDI mapping target ids must not localize.
- MIDI control labels shown to the user may localize.
- Exported profiles should not require a locale to function.

## Tauri and Installer Localization

Desktop localization has platform-specific pieces:

- macOS usage descriptions in `src-tauri/Info.plist`.
- Windows installer metadata and future signed publisher presentation.
- Linux desktop metadata.
- Tauri dialog/error strings.
- Updater messages.

Before shipping a new locale:

1. Confirm app UI strings are translated.
2. Confirm permission usage strings are translated or intentionally English.
3. Confirm installer/update text is translated where the platform supports it.
4. Confirm layout still fits compact panels.
5. Confirm accessibility labels match visible labels.
6. Confirm docs tell users which languages are supported.

## Testing Expectations

Current checks:

```bash
npm run build
npm run smoke:static
```

Future i18n checks should include:

- missing-key detection.
- unused-key detection.
- smoke test in each supported locale.
- screenshot/layout checks for compact panels with longer strings.
- permission/error message checks.
- import/export compatibility checks across locales.

## Current Boundaries

Out of scope today:

- Machine translation pipeline.
- Runtime download of translation catalogs.
- Localized documentation site.
- Right-to-left layout support.
- Locale-specific presets or culture-specific visual defaults.
- Localization of hardware device names or user-authored content.

These can be revisited after the core desktop app, release process, and
renderer behavior stabilize.
