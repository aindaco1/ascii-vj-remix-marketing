# Internationalization

This guide documents the current language boundary, string ownership, and
localization-safe rules for ASCII VJ Remix.

## Current Baseline

- English is the only supported app and documentation language.
- The app has no translation catalog or locale switcher.
- Most UI strings live directly in `index.html`, `app.js`, and related frontend
  modules.
- Tauri metadata, desktop dialogs, status/error messages, and macOS usage
  descriptions are English.
- User preset names, file names, and hardware device names are displayed as
  authored or reported by the operating system.
- The app does not download translations or other language resources at
  runtime.
- Multilingual glyph rendering is supported independently of UI localization.
  The neutral bundled atlas covers selected Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, symbol,
  CJK/Kana, and Hangul blocks, but the control UI remains English.

Prospective catalog, locale, and translation-workflow work is tracked only in
the [Roadmap](/docs/reference/roadmap/).

## Current String Ownership

| String Type | Current Owner | Current Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App control labels | `index.html`, `app.js`, and frontend modules | English literals. |
| Status and error messages | Frontend modules and Rust/Tauri commands | English literals. |
| Preset ids | Code and preset data | Stable and language-independent. |
| Built-in preset display names | Preset data | English names. |
| Palette and glyph-set ids | Shared catalogs | Stable and language-independent. |
| Typed custom glyph ramps | User data | Preserved as supported Unicode scalars, capped at 96. |
| User preset names | User data | Displayed exactly as authored. |
| Device names | OS and hardware | Displayed as provided by the platform. |
| File names | OS and user data | Displayed as provided by the platform. |
| Product metadata | Tauri config and platform resources | Product name remains `ASCII VJ Remix`. |
| macOS usage strings | `src-tauri/Info.plist` | English descriptions of active permissions. |
| Documentation | Markdown files | English. |

## Rules for User-Visible Text

- Keep runtime strings and assets bundled locally.
- Keep stable internal ids separate from display strings.
- Do not localize user media paths, file names, custom preset names, hardware
  device names, backend ids, codec names, MIDI channels, CC numbers, SysEx
  bytes, or file extensions.
- Avoid building sentences by concatenating fragments.
- Keep pluralization and units separable.
- Leave room for longer copy in compact control panels.
- Keep labels close to their controls and keep accessible labels aligned with
  visible labels.
- Avoid text baked into images.
- Keep keyboard shortcuts and MIDI identifiers separate from prose.
- Preserve the product name `ASCII VJ Remix` in platform metadata.

## Numbers, Units, and Formats

Current controls display seconds, FPS, columns/rows, width/height, percentages,
normalized values, device names, and file names directly from app or platform
state. Technical units and identifiers remain stable across the interface.

Code that adds a formatted user-visible value keeps the value separate from its
label and avoids hard-coded sentence fragments. Locale-aware number formatting
is not currently implemented.

## Presets, WTF, Audio, and MIDI

- Built-in and user preset ids remain stable.
- User preset names remain user-authored.
- Imported and exported preset data does not require a locale to function.
- MIDI target ids, page ids, channels, CC numbers, SysEx bytes, and stored preset
  ids remain language-independent.
- Device names and file names remain platform/user data rather than app copy.
- Palette ids, dither-mode ids, atlas-style ids, and character-set ids remain
  stable even if their display labels are localized later.

## Multilingual Glyph Output

Glyph coverage is a rendering feature, not a claim that the app UI or generated
output is translated. Version 0.9.11 supports CJK punctuation/radicals,
Hiragana, Katakana, CJK Unified Ideographs U+4E00-U+9FFF, and Hangul syllables
alongside the documented Latin/Greek/Cyrillic/symbol blocks.

The renderer treats one Unicode scalar as one visual cell. It does not perform
grapheme-cluster segmentation, script shaping, bidirectional paragraph layout,
emoji-sequence composition, or readable text layout. Unsupported scalars are
removed from typed ramps with bounded textual feedback. Extension A and
supplementary CJK planes remain roadmap work.

## Tauri and Installer Text

Desktop text currently spans:

- macOS usage descriptions in `src-tauri/Info.plist`;
- Windows and Linux package metadata;
- Tauri dialog and error strings; and
- updater messages.

These strings are English and must remain accurate for the behavior and
permissions present in the packaged app.

## Current Validation

The general build and static smoke checks exercise the current English UI:

```bash
npm run build
npm run smoke:static
```

There is no missing-key, unused-key, locale-layout, or cross-locale
import/export suite because the app has no catalog or additional supported
locale. This gap is recorded in [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/).

## Current Boundaries

The current product does not include machine translation, runtime catalog
downloads, translated documentation, right-to-left layout, locale-specific
presets, or localization of hardware/user-authored data. Those are roadmap
decisions rather than undocumented current capabilities.
