# Security

This guide documents the current security model, accepted tradeoffs, and
validation practices for ASCII VJ Remix.

ASCII VJ Remix's risk profile is a local-first Tauri desktop app that handles
local media, cameras, microphones, system audio, native output windows, bundled
FFmpeg sidecars, signed update artifacts, and reviewed/sanitized crash reports.

## Security Principles

- Keep the packaged app local-first and offline by default.
- Do not add CDNs, hosted fonts, hosted codecs, telemetry, hosted renderers, or
  runtime dependency downloads.
- Treat the GitHub Releases updater and production-only crash reporter as the
  only intentional online runtime paths.
- Keep user-selected media, camera frames, and audio analysis local.
- Require explicit user selection before reading a local file.
- Keep Tauri capabilities narrow and window-specific.
- Keep the output window as a presentation surface, not a second privileged app
  controller.
- Keep release signing, updater signing, and notarization secrets out of the
  repository.
- Preserve the bundle identifier `com.asciline.remix` unless there is a planned
  migration for existing macOS privacy grants.

## Security Architecture

| Surface | Current Boundary | Risk Level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local image/video files | Browser File API or Tauri dialog plus session-local media registry | Medium | Files are selected explicitly and should not grant broad filesystem access. |
| Built-in demo media | Bundled under `media/` and copied into app assets | Low | Demo media is local and versioned. |
| Camera input | Browser `getUserMedia`; macOS native AVFoundation path for Pop Out | Medium | Requires OS privacy permission. Frames stay local. |
| Mic/input audio | Web Audio and native Tauri providers | Medium | Requires OS privacy permission. Analysis features should be bounded. |
| System/display audio | Browser display audio when present; native desktop providers where available | Medium | Platform permissions vary. Do not broaden capture beyond feature needs. |
| Presets/settings | Local browser storage, IndexedDB, imported/exported JSON | Low to Medium | User-authored data. Validate imports before applying. |
| Output window | Tauri output window with minimal permissions | Medium | Must not expose media selection, filesystem, updater, or broad command APIs. |
| Tauri commands | `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` plus capability files | High | Treat every command as a security boundary. Validate inputs in Rust. |
| Asset protocol | Empty by default, expanded only for selected media/session needs | High | Avoid persistent broad paths. |
| FFmpeg sidecars | Bundled resources with policy checks and source/provenance metadata | Medium | No runtime downloads. Release sidecars should disable network protocols. |
| Updater | GitHub Releases endpoint with signed updater packages | High | Private signing key is external. Public key is committed. |
| Crash reporter | Rust-only POST to `https://crash.dustwave.xyz/v1/reports` in production builds | High | Reports are bounded, sanitized, user-configurable, and relayed to GitHub issues by a Cloudflare Worker. |
| Logs and smoke reports | Local developer/test artifacts | Low to Medium | Do not log private file paths, raw audio, or sensitive environment values unless needed for explicit debugging. |

## Release Hardening Notes

The current release line includes these security hardening rules:

- Production CSP allows only the app origin, Tauri IPC, and the Tauri asset
  protocol needed for selected local media. Localhost HTTP/WebSocket endpoints
  belong in development CSP only until stream mode is productized.
- Crash report submission is implemented in Rust, not webview `fetch`, so the
  production CSP does not gain arbitrary remote `connect-src` access.
- GitHub Actions updater signing secrets are scoped to the updater-secret check
  and Tauri packaging steps. Do not place `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`,
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`, Apple certificate values, or keychain
  passwords in job-level workflow environment blocks.
- Public 0.9.3 release CI fails closed when Apple Developer ID notarization is
  incomplete. Windows artifacts are published as unsigned previews until
  SignPath Foundation, Azure Artifact Signing, or another signing backend is
  proven.
- GitHub Actions macOS jobs are pinned to `macos-26` instead of
  `macos-latest`. The native `wgpu`/`apple-metal` stack needs the macOS 26
  Metal SDK, and the moving `macos-latest` alias can select an older SDK.
- Selected local media paths should not be retained in frontend app state after
  the app derives the playback URL it needs. Diagnostics should redact file and
  asset URLs before writing `/tmp/asciline-media-diagnostics.log`.
- Session-local Tauri asset grants should be revoked when a selected media
  registration is forgotten and no other registration still uses that path.
- Preset imports must be bounded, schema-checked, clamped through the shared
  control metadata, and stripped of source/media fields before they can affect
  renderer state.
- Glyph-mode native output should treat `charset` as allowlisted data and keep
  `fontFamily` out of native font-loading/resource lookup paths.
- Dependency audits should include npm and Rust. `cargo audit` warnings from
  Tauri's current GTK/WebKit transitive stack are tracked as upstream desktop
  framework risk; actionable direct/transitive advisories should be fixed before
  release when an upgrade is available.

## Tauri Runtime Policy

The production runtime is intentionally narrow:

- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` keeps a restrictive production Content Security
  Policy.
- Production CSP does not allow arbitrary localhost HTTP/WebSocket endpoints;
  localhost stream/dev endpoints belong only in `devCsp` until stream mode is
  productized for normal users.
- `npm run check:tauri-policy` verifies the local-only runtime policy, the
  GitHub updater endpoint exception, and the Rust-only crash reporter command
  boundary.
- Capabilities in `src-tauri/capabilities/` split main-window privileges from
  output-window privileges.
- The main window owns media selection, output management, audio providers, and
  updater/crash-report work.
- The output window should only listen for render/output messages and expose
  the minimum close/fullscreen behavior it needs.

When adding a Tauri command:

1. Prefer a narrow command with typed inputs over a generic command.
2. Validate paths, ids, dimensions, enum values, and numeric bounds in Rust.
3. Grant the command only to the window that needs it.
4. Avoid returning raw filesystem paths to the webview unless the UI needs to
   display a user-selected filename.
5. Add or update a test/check when the command changes the app's security
   posture.

## Crash Reporting

Crash reporting is opt-in by preference and production-only for network
submission. Debug/dev builds can capture local reports for testing, but Rust
refuses to submit them.

The crash reporter can capture:

- frontend `error` events.
- frontend `unhandledrejection` events.
- Tauri command failures.
- Rust panic-hook reports imported on the next launch.

Security requirements:

- Reports must be bounded before local storage and before submission.
- Reports must redact local paths, asset/file URLs, emails, tokens, cookies,
  passwords, and auth-like context keys.
- Reports must not include user media files, decoded frames, screenshots, raw
  audio, local storage dumps, environment dumps, or arbitrary logs.
- The app stores at most a small local queue and lets the user choose `ask`,
  `always`, or `off`.
- Submission uses the Rust command surface only. The output window must not have
  crash-report permissions.
- GitHub credentials must not be present in the desktop app, repository config,
  or client-visible bundle.

Crash relay architecture:

```text
release desktop app
  -> Rust crash reporter command
  -> https://crash.dustwave.xyz/v1/reports
  -> Cloudflare Worker validation, rate limiting, and sanitization
  -> GitHub App installation token
  -> aggregated GitHub issue
```

The Cloudflare Worker lives in `crash-relay/`. Its GitHub App secrets are set
with `wrangler secret put`, and its KV namespaces rate-limit intake and index
crash fingerprints. Similar reports update one open issue instead of creating a
new issue for every report. The fingerprint prefers stable dimensions such as
kind, surface, platform, command/backend/source mode, native-output state, and
explicit error-code fields; normalized stack frame or message are fallbacks.
Issue bodies keep bounded aggregate state rather than concatenating every
report.

## Local Media and File Access

Custom files must stay behind explicit user selection.

Rules:

- Do not add broad home-directory, downloads-folder, removable-drive, or
  recursive directory grants.
- Do not persist raw file access capabilities beyond what the platform requires
  for the selected session.
- Do not upload selected media to a server.
- Do not send media paths to analytics or remote logs.
- Imported preset/profile files must be parsed and validated as data, not
  executed.
- Future preset bundles must not include private media files or absolute media
  paths unless the user explicitly exports that information.

## Camera, Microphone, and System Audio

Camera and audio capture are sensitive local inputs. They should be started only
from explicit app behavior that the user can understand, such as selecting
Camera or enabling Audio Reactivity. Audio Reactivity is currently an intentional
default product mode, so the app may request microphone/input permission during
startup. Capture remains OS-gated and local, and the user can stop it by
disabling Audio Reactivity or changing the audio source.

Current macOS bundle identifier:

```text
com.asciline.remix
```

Permission reset helpers:

```bash
tccutil reset Camera com.asciline.remix
tccutil reset Microphone com.asciline.remix
tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.asciline.remix
tccutil reset AudioCapture com.asciline.remix
```

Development rules:

- Keep usage strings in `src-tauri/Info.plist` accurate and specific.
- Keep entitlements in `src-tauri/Entitlements.plist` aligned with real feature
  use.
- Prefer narrower native system-audio permissions when the platform exposes
  them.
- Keep feature frames bounded. Do not ship raw unbounded audio buffers over
  IPC when feature vectors are enough. Audio reactivity should use derived
  features such as RMS, bands, transient/flux, presence, brightness, density,
  beat pulse, and phase.
- Avoid capture auto-retry loops that keep prompting or capturing after the user
  denies access.

## Updater and Release Secrets

The updater is the intentional online path. It reads:

```text
https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/releases/latest/download/latest.json
```

Security requirements:

- Updater packages must be signed.
- The public updater key belongs in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
- The private updater key belongs in GitHub Actions secret
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- The updater key password belongs in GitHub Actions secret
  `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`; encrypted updater keys cannot be signed
  in noninteractive release jobs without it.
- Do not commit `/private/tmp/ascii-vj-remix-updater.key` or any replacement
  private key.
- Use `npm run updater:secret:set` and `npm run updater:secret:check` for the
  current GitHub secret workflow.
- Release workflows must not print secret values or pass private keys as
  command-line arguments.
- Release workflows must scope updater signing secrets to signing-only steps,
  never to the whole job.

Apple Developer ID signing adds more secrets. Store certificates, passwords, API
keys, and CI keychain passwords in GitHub secrets only, and keep local test
credentials outside the repo. Future Windows Authenticode signing must follow
the same rule for Azure client secrets, SignPath tokens, certificates, or other
signing credentials. Non-secret Azure IDs for Artifact Signing may live in
GitHub repository variables if Azure Artifact Signing is enabled later.

## FFmpeg and Codec Sidecars

FFmpeg sidecars are bundled to keep media functionality standalone. They are
also an important supply-chain and licensing boundary.

Rules:

- Do not download FFmpeg, codecs, or media helper binaries at runtime.
- Release sidecars should be built from pinned official source.
- Network protocols should remain disabled for release FFmpeg builds unless a
  productized streaming feature explicitly requires a reviewed exception.
- Sidecars need version, SHA-256, license, source, and NOTICE metadata.
- Do not commit generated sidecar binaries unless the release policy changes.

Validation:

```bash
npm run test:ffmpeg-policy
npm run check:ffmpeg-resources
npm run check:ffmpeg-release
```

## Presets, MIDI, and Future Profiles

Presets and future MIDI maps are local data, but they can still break the app if
the import path trusts them.

Import rules:

- Parse as JSON data only.
- Validate schema version and supported fields.
- Clamp numeric values through the same live-control metadata used by the UI.
- Keep character sets allowlisted and bounded before they reach native output.
- Reject unknown structural fields instead of silently applying them.
- Do not let imported presets disable Stats Overlay unless the user imported
  that choice intentionally and the UI makes it clear.
- Do not include private absolute media paths in exported packs by default.

## Security Validation

Use the smallest relevant check set for the change.

General:

```bash
git diff --check
npm run check:offline
npm run check:tauri-policy
```

Desktop security and packaging:

```bash
npm run check:desktop
npm run test:macos-secret-args
npm run release:secrets:check
```

Updater:

```bash
npm run test:updater-manifest
npm run updater:secret:check
```

FFmpeg and media sidecars:

```bash
npm run test:ffmpeg-policy
npm run check:ffmpeg-resources
```

## Known Risks and Deferred Hardening

- macOS privacy prompts can be sensitive to app path, bundle identifier, and
  signing identity.
- Ad-hoc macOS signing is acceptable for local builds only; public releases are
  Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled, and Gatekeeper-validated.
- Windows 0.9.3 artifacts are unsigned previews and may trigger Unknown
  Publisher, SmartScreen, or Defender warnings. Future public Windows releases
  should be Authenticode signed and timestamped before being treated as normal
  public installers.
- Linux media/camera/audio behavior varies by distribution, WebKitGTK, drivers,
  and portal setup.
- Stream mode exists in development paths but is hidden from the normal UI until
  it is productized and security-reviewed.
- Future MIDI mappings need import validation, mapping scopes, and rate limits
  before they are treated as user-shareable profile packs.
