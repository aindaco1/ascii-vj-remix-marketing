# Accessibility

This guide establishes accessibility best practices for ASCII VJ Remix and
tracks the current baseline.

The controls still need to be accessible, but the renderer output itself is
creative media that may intentionally be high contrast, animated, jittery, and
visually intense.

## Current Baseline

Accessibility is early for this project. The current app benefits from:

- high-contrast black, white, grey, neon pink, and neon blue UI colors.
- mostly standard HTML buttons, sliders, select controls, checkboxes, and file
  picker flows.
- compact but visible control grouping.
- persistent Stats Overlay for renderer state.
- platform-native permission prompts for camera, microphone, and system audio.

Known limitations:

- No comprehensive keyboard-only audit has been completed.
- No screen-reader pass has been completed.
- No automated axe/ARIA snapshot suite exists yet.
- The dense VJ control surface has many sliders and buttons that need stronger
  focus and labeling coverage over time.
- The visual output can include rapid motion, high contrast, jitter, and color
  shifts by design.

## Accessibility Principles

- Preserve control density without sacrificing focus visibility or readable
  labels.
- Prefer native controls before custom widgets.
- Make every interactive control keyboard reachable.
- Keep focus order aligned with visual order.
- Do not rely on color alone for critical state.
- Keep visible focus states strong against the black UI theme.
- Use ARIA only where native semantics are insufficient.
- Keep live status updates polite unless the user must act immediately.
- Do not let aesthetic changes reduce contrast or target size.
- Keep output-window controls minimal and predictable.

## Critical Interaction Surfaces

The highest-risk accessibility surfaces are:

1. Source selection, custom-file selection, and source status.
2. Camera device list and multi-camera selection.
3. Preset buttons, user preset actions, and import/export overflow menu.
4. Sliders and numeric controls across Grid, Color, Sampling, Audio Reactivity,
   and future MIDI.
5. WTF mode active/inactive state.
6. Audio Reactivity source/device/preset controls and permission states.
7. Pop Out and fullscreen/output-display controls.
8. Stats Overlay content.
9. Permission recovery and error messaging.

## UI Control Rules

Use these rules for new UI work:

- Buttons need accessible names that match their action.
- Icon-only controls need a label via `aria-label` or equivalent visible text.
- Toggle buttons should expose pressed/on state.
- Sliders need visible labels, accessible labels, min/max/current values, and
  keyboard support.
- Mutually exclusive choices should use radio buttons, a select, or an ARIA
  pattern that is tested with keyboard input.
- Checkbox groups need a group label.
- File picker controls should announce selected filename/presence state.
- Menus and overflow controls must close with Escape and restore focus.
- Status/error text should appear near the triggering control and use an
  appropriate status or alert region when dynamic.
- Disabled or irrelevant controls should be hidden or disabled consistently,
  matching the conditional-knob model.

## Keyboard Expectations

Minimum keyboard behavior:

- Tab moves through controls in a useful order.
- Shift+Tab reverses the same order.
- Enter/Space activates buttons and toggles.
- Arrow keys operate sliders and native selects.
- Escape closes transient menus, popovers, and dialogs.
- Focus is not trapped in the preview/output canvas.
- Opening and closing Pop Out does not steal focus permanently from the main
  controls.

For future MIDI Learn and mapping dialogs:

- mappings must be creatable without pointer input.
- waiting-for-input states must be announced.
- cancel/clear/reset actions must be keyboard reachable.

## Motion, Flashing, and Visual Intensity

ASCII VJ Remix is designed for extreme visuals, but the control UI should still
respect accessibility needs.

Current rule:

- The app may generate intense visuals when the user selects extreme presets or
  WTF mode, but controls must remain readable and operable.

Future candidates:

- A reduced-motion preference for UI transitions.
- A photosensitivity safety option that limits extreme flicker/jitter in
  randomized modes.
- Clear user-facing warnings for performance sets that intentionally use rapid
  flashes or high-contrast changes.
- A way to exclude specific presets from WTF/randomized mode.

## Color and Contrast

The current theme should keep:

- black/graphite surfaces for structure.
- white as the primary active/focus color.
- neon blue for ready/on/positive states.
- neon pink for warning/update/WTF states.
- red for errors.

Rules:

- Hover states must keep text readable. A light hover background needs dark
  text.
- Focus rings must be visible against both black and grey panels.
- Error and warning states need text/icon/state differences, not color only.
- The logo/light blue legacy color should not be used as the main UI accent
  unless the theme changes intentionally.

## Automated Coverage Goals

Current checks are indirect:

```bash
npm run build
npm run smoke:static
```

Near-term accessibility checks to add:

- Playwright keyboard smoke for Source, Presets, WTF, Audio Reactivity, and Pop
  Out controls.
- Axe checks for the main control window.
- ARIA snapshots for major panels.
- Focus-order assertions for compact panels.
- Reduced-motion behavior checks once the preference exists.
- Hover/focus color contrast checks for the black/neon theme.

## Manual Accessibility Checklist

Before shipping meaningful UI changes:

- Launch the app and use Tab through the full sidebar.
- Confirm Source entries can be selected without a pointer.
- Confirm preset buttons are reachable and have useful names.
- Confirm Import/Export overflow opens, closes, and restores focus.
- Confirm every slider can be adjusted from the keyboard.
- Confirm WTF mode exposes active/inactive state.
- Confirm audio permission errors are readable and actionable.
- Confirm camera permission errors are readable and actionable.
- Confirm Pop Out can be opened and closed without losing main-window control.
- Confirm hover text remains readable on unselected Source entries.
- Confirm Stats Overlay does not block essential controls.

## Accepted Limits

- The rendered ASCII/video output is artistic media and may not be suitable for
  every viewer in every mode.
- Some platform permission dialogs are owned by macOS, Windows, Linux, or the
  embedded webview.
- Camera and audio device names come from the operating system and may not be
  localized or screen-reader friendly.

These limits do not exempt the app controls from keyboard, contrast, labeling,
and focus requirements.
