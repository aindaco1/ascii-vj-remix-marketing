# Roadmap

This roadmap separates the released 0.9.5 feature baseline, active 0.9.6 work,
and planned follow-on work.
It is meant to guide product, renderer, desktop packaging, and contribution
decisions.

## Active Release Work: 0.9.6

### Performance Without Quality Reduction

- Reuse WebGPU uniform storage, texture views, and stable bind groups instead
  of recreating them per frame.
- Cache WebGL2 uniform locations after program linking.
- Keep numeric transition frames on the small control/value update path; run
  source, camera, visibility, meter, and complete control-surface refreshes only
  at the final state boundary.
- Version native Pop Out source frames so display-refresh presentation and live
  param modulation do not repeatedly convert and upload an unchanged 24 FPS
  video frame at 60 FPS.
- Preserve shader code, renderer math, source/output resolution, glyph quality,
  and every visible quality control.
- Keep optimized-build measurement repeatable with clean defaults, fixed
  non-structural transition targets, P10/P50 metrics, exact bundle selection,
  and native upload/skip counters.

### MIDI Commissioning Resumed

- Keep MIDI labeled experimental and keep Ensure Profile on Connection off
  until manual restore and byte-for-byte verification succeed.
- Program faders/rotaries as matching CC 1-33 on individual channel 00.
- Program C34-C47 with extended mode 146, matching CC 34-47, press 127,
  release 0, and individual channel 00. Plain standard-CC button mode is a
  toggle and is not acceptable.
- Store the common surface in memories 01-04 with global channels 1-4.
- Complete full-bank capture, explicit restore, recall, verification, physical
  sweep, reconnect, soft-takeover, numeric-slot, and forbidden-action checks on
  macOS Apple Silicon.
- Retain direct UC-33e USB and physical Windows/Linux validation as follow-on
  work.

### macOS Permission Identity Safeguards

- Keep public releases on `ASCII VJ Remix` / `com.asciline.remix` and normal
  development on `ASCII VJ Remix Dev` / `com.asciline.remix.dev`.
- Require a stable local signing identity before launching a development bundle
  that will request Camera, Microphone, or System Audio access.
- Prevent local tooling from copying or re-signing the production app.
- Require public updater archives to retain Developer ID Team ID `PWT3Q52LZ2`,
  hardened runtime, and the same team-based designated requirement across
  releases.
- Run an application-driven macOS updater replacement after publication and
  revalidate the resulting app identity.

### macOS DMG Installation Hardening

- Tauri remains the single owner of DMG creation, with its app-to-Applications
  layout explicit in the committed configuration.
- The shared mounted-image contract verifies integrity, the real app bundle,
  `Applications -> /Applications`, and reviewed Tauri metadata.
- Reuse the existing app identity, signing, stapling, Gatekeeper, and updater
  archive checks against the app mounted from the final notarized DMG.
- Published-release smoke requires the downloaded DMG before exercising the
  existing updater hop.
- Keep EasyDMG and similar cautious handlers optional; do not add an automatic
  installer or runtime dependency.
- The optimized local app/DMG canary passes the shared mounted bundle check. A
  Developer ID signed/notarized one-DMG canary remains required before claiming
  the 0.9.6 install work is release-ready. See
  [macOS Installation Hardening Plan for 0.9.6](https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/blob/main/docs/MACOS_INSTALL_0.9.6_PLAN.md).

## Product Direction

ASCII VJ Remix is a local-first renderer lab for live ASCII and cell-based
visuals. It combines:

- ASCILINE's high-performance ASCII video lineage: adaptive frame encoding,
  Python/OpenCV experiments, terminal playback ideas, Canvas fallback paths, and
  stream-oriented media preparation.
- The `ascii-point-and-click` renderer's high-quality WebGPU/WebGL visual
  output and browser-native media-source architecture.
- A Tauri desktop shell that keeps the app standalone, offline by default, and
  usable for live output workflows.

The project is not adopting the point-and-click game UI. The target is a dense
creative control surface for video, image, camera, audio-reactive, and
MIDI-driven ASCII visuals.

## Current Feature Baseline: 0.9.5

### Local-First Desktop App With Vite Harness

- The same vanilla HTML/CSS/ESM renderer lab runs inside Tauri, with a Vite
  static harness retained for development and smoke tests.
- Vite builds a deterministic `dist/` bundle.
- Runtime assets are copied locally into the build output.
- Packaged desktop builds are designed to run without online connectivity.
- Intentional online runtime paths are limited to the GitHub Releases updater and
  production-only reviewed/sanitized crash report submission.

### Source Workflow

- The normal UI starts in static local-source mode.
- Demo Image is the default startup source.
- Demo Video is the single visible built-in video source.
- Extra point-and-click MP4 fixtures remain hidden development/test assets.
- Custom local image/video files can be selected through the desktop/webview
  file picker path.
- Tauri custom files are exposed through a session-local asset protocol grant,
  not broad filesystem access.
- Camera is a first-class source.
- Multiple camera devices can be selected when the OS and embedded webview allow
  concurrent capture.
- The camera mixer composites multiple cameras locally with Canvas2D.
- Camera controls appear directly below Source while Camera is active.
- Static media URL and manual media-type selectors are intentionally absent from
  the normal UI. Source type is inferred.

### Stream Status

- Legacy FastAPI/WebSocket streaming code remains in the repository.
- The adaptive RAW/ZLIB/DELTA codec is still part of the codebase and test
  suite.
- Rust/FFmpeg media session work exists for future local stream-mode packaging.
- StreamRuntime can consume native session batches in Tauri development paths.
- Stream mode is not yet a normal user-facing source mode.
- The Static/Streaming selector, buffer counter, stream connection label, and
  stream-specific control surface stay hidden until stream mode is productized
  end to end.

### Rendering Backends

- WebGPU is the primary quality target on capable Chromium/WebView runtimes.
- WebGL2 is the main GPU fallback.
- Canvas2D glyph/text and pixel Canvas remain compatibility fallbacks.
- Auto backend selection prefers the best available renderer while preserving a
  manual backend selector.
- The renderer uses a single canonical parameter model for UI controls, presets,
  randomization, audio modulation, and output synchronization.

### Live Renderer Controls

The current control model includes:

- Source: built-in media, custom files, Camera, loop, mute, volume.
- Camera: device multi-select, facing mode when relevant, capture size, capture
  FPS, layout, framing, mirror.
- Backend: Auto, WebGPU, WebGL2, Canvas2D, Pixel Canvas.
- Grid: columns, rows, auto rows, cell width, cell height, aspect correction.
- Color: saturation, contrast, brightness, gamma, background blend,
  quantization, stream color mode where relevant.
- Sampling: target FPS, jitter amount, jitter speed, sample X/Y, smoothing.
- Glyph/Cell: glyph mode, solid mode, compact character set and font family
  menus, minimum glyph intensity.
- Performance: stats overlay, backend status, FPS, grid size.
- Audio Reactivity: source, preset, input device, sensitivity, smoothing, beat,
  bass, mid, treble, transient/flux, presence, density dampening, noise floor,
  and live meters.
- Output: Pop Out, output display selector, fullscreen-capable output window.

Controls are conditionally hidden when they are not relevant to the active
source/backend.

### UI Theme

- The UI uses an extreme black/white/grey palette with neon pink and neon blue
  state accents instead of the earlier saturated blue surfaces.
- Dense control layout, compact panel sizing, and VCR-style monospace
  typography are preserved.
- Graphite panel levels separate the app shell, toolbar, inspector, groups, and
  rows without reducing readability.
- White is the primary active/focus accent and replaces the earlier light
  blue/purple surfaces.
- Neon blue is reserved for ready/on states.
- Neon pink is reserved for warning, update, and WTF states.
- Red remains reserved for error states.
- Theme color is centralized through CSS tokens so future palette changes do
  not require scattered hard-coded edits.

### Presets and Transitions

- Built-in presets are read-only.
- Users can save, duplicate, update, delete, import, and export presets.
- Preset panel stays compact while supporting a large preset set.
- Transitions use the configured duration in seconds.
- Numeric params tween smoothly.
- Discrete params flip at controlled points when necessary.
- Renderer rebuilds use two-surface crossfades instead of fade-to-black.
- Transitions preserve media source and video playback time when the source is
  unchanged.
- Current built-ins include:
  - Point & Click Default.
  - Classic Camera ASCII.
  - ANSI Newsprint.
  - Terminal Mono.
  - Dense Typewriter.
  - Twenty-three credited ascii.today character-set adaptations, from Broadway
    KB through Doh; see
    [ascii.today Character Presets](https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/blob/main/docs/ASCII_TODAY_PRESETS.md).
  - Neon Sledgehammer.
  - Arcade Rain.
  - Gamma Sinkhole.
  - Chrome Wound.
  - Candy Fragmenter.
  - Posterized Dream.
  - Dead Channel Confetti.
  - Solar Guillotine.
  - Paper Shredder.
  - Cyberdelic Riot.
  - Night Vision Terminal.
  - White-Hot Decoder.
  - Acid Snowstorm.
  - Pixel Mirage.
  - Chromatic Meltdown.
  - Blacklight Crush.
  - Signal Loss.
  - Sugar Voltage.
  - Teletext Reactor.
  - Bitcrush Sunburn.
  - Ditherpunk Ultra.
  - Terminal Collapse.
  - Infrared Riot.
  - Laser Rot.
  - Static Cathedral.
  - Toxic Halftone.
  - Plasma Bruise.
  - Magma Telemetry.
  - Glitch Orchid.
  - Ultraviolet Siren.
  - Neon Razorstorm.

### WTF Mode

- WTF mode toggles continuous randomized transitions.
- It uses randomized transition durations.
- It leans into extreme preset families, traditional ASCII preset anchors, and
  randomized live-safe controls.
- It avoids pure black and pure white output states.
- It does not turn off Stats Overlay.
- Source switching cancels and resumes safely without leaving the renderer stuck
  on the previous source.

### Audio-Reactive Rendering

- Audio Reactivity is enabled by default.
- Mic/Input is the default audio source.
- Concrete audio devices can be selected.
- Switching audio input devices restarts capture automatically.
- Audio file reactivity works locally.
- Browser display/tab audio works when the platform provides audio tracks.
- Tauri desktop builds include native audio capture providers for desktop
  testing.
- Analysis extracts RMS, bass, low-mid, mid, high-mid, treble, presence,
  brightness, density, spectral flux, beat pulse, and a phase clock.
- Dense-mix controls reduce broadband overreaction on busy songs while keeping
  sparse transients responsive.
- Modulation is applied as effective params and does not persist back into
  saved presets.
- Safe clamps prevent high sensitivity from causing pure black or pure white
  screens.
- Stats Overlay reports the active audio-reactive preset/state.

### Native Output and Pop Out

- The main UI remains the control surface.
- Pop Out opens a separate output window.
- Tauri desktop builds prefer a native `wgpu` output surface.
- macOS uses Metal.
- Windows targets D3D12 through `wgpu`.
- Linux targets Vulkan/GLES through `wgpu`.
- Static images, SVGs, video files, and single-camera sources can use native
  output paths.
- Traditional glyph-mode presets preserve their character-set masks in native
  `wgpu` output.
- Native glyph output uses bounded fixed atlas/ramp resources rather than
  loading user-selected fonts in the native path.
- macOS single-camera Pop Out uses a native AVFoundation capture path to reduce
  camera latency.
- Native-output failures retain a webview/canvas fallback.
- Output display selection is persisted when monitor enumeration is available.
- Secondary-display placement is covered by deterministic simulation tests.

### Experimental Native MIDI Hardware Control (0.9.5)

- The initial experimental rig is an Evolution/M-Audio UC-33e connected by DIN
  in both directions through an iConnectivity mioXC.
- Rust `midir` provides native input/output with CoreMIDI as the primary tested
  backend and Windows/Linux backends retained for validation.
- Four UC memories provide Visual, Audio, Presets, and Fine/User pages.
- All 47 assignable controls have default mappings on every page.
- Soft takeover, coalescing, MIDI Learn, stable preset slots, and reconnect
  monitoring are implemented.
- Full-bank SysEx can be captured, explicitly restored, and verified. Optional
  Ensure Profile on Connection is off by default.
- MIDI cannot change media sources, Camera, Pop Out, or output displays.
- The full controller map and hardware procedure live in
  [MIDI_UC33E](https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/blob/main/docs/MIDI_UC33E.md).

#### Hardware Commissioning Status: Resuming in 0.9.6

MIDI remains experimental at the implemented and automated-test-passing state. The physical session
confirmed that this UC-33e identifies the numeric keypad as C34–C43 and the
Stop, Play, Rewind, and Fast-forward transport buttons as C44–C47. Those ids
are now the canonical Page 3 mapping.

Resume checklist:

1. Program C34–C47 with UC-33e extended button mode 146 as momentary Control
   Change messages whose CC number matches the controller id, with release
   value 0 and press value 127.
2. Store UC memories 01–04 with global MIDI channels 1–4 and the documented
   Visual, Audio, Presets, and Fine/User maps.
3. Capture a verified full-bank SysEx dump from the powered, bidirectionally
   connected UC-33e/mioXC rig.
4. Exercise Install/Restore and Verify against that captured profile.
5. Enable and validate optional Ensure Profile on Connection only after manual
   restore succeeds.
6. Complete the physical control sweep, reconnect test, soft-takeover test, and
   forbidden-action acceptance check on macOS Apple Silicon.
7. Perform physical Windows and Linux validation later; direct UC-33e USB stays
   deferred.

No new MIDI scope is planned during commissioning; failures should be fixed
within the existing visual/audio-only security boundary.

### Desktop Security and Packaging

- Tauri v2 is the desktop shell.
- Production CSP blocks arbitrary remote HTTP(S) runtime access.
- Asset protocol scope is empty by default and expanded only for session-local
  selected media.
- Capabilities are split between main and output windows.
- Main window can select media, manage output, use audio providers, and invoke
  updater actions.
- Output window has minimal listen/close/fullscreen permissions.
- macOS camera, microphone, screen capture, and audio capture usage strings are
  present.
- Normal macOS development builds use a separate `.dev` bundle identity and the
  local launcher requires stable signing. Public release CI requires Developer
  ID signing and notarization under the production identity.
- Windows 0.9.3 release CI publishes unsigned preview artifacts. Signed Windows
  public distribution is deferred until SignPath Foundation, Azure Artifact
  Signing, or another signing backend is proven.
- GitHub Releases updater infrastructure is configured.
- Release CI builds signed updater artifacts when the private key is present.
- Production crash reporting captures bounded sanitized frontend, Tauri command,
  and Rust panic reports and sends them through a Cloudflare Worker relay to
  aggregated GitHub issues when enabled.

### FFmpeg and Media Engine Work

- Rust media-engine modules can probe and decode local video through FFmpeg.
- Frame prep can produce ASCILINE-compatible ASCII color and pixel buffers.
- Adaptive codec encode/decode parity is tested.
- FFmpeg sidecars are staged with version, SHA-256, license, source, and NOTICE
  metadata.
- Release CI source-builds pinned FFmpeg 8.1.2 sidecars with network protocols
  disabled and LGPL-compatible configuration.
- Packaged stream mode is not yet promoted to normal users.

### Validation

Current checks include:

- `npm run smoke:static`.
- `npm run check:offline`.
- `npm run check:desktop`.
- `npm run check:release`.
- `npm run test:output-display`.
- `npm run test:updater-manifest`.
- `npm run test:frame-prep`.
- `npm run test:decode-resize`.
- `npm run check:media`.
- `npm run test:rust`.
- `npm run test:vectors`.
- `npm run test:render-math`.
- `npm run test:crash-relay`.
- Native output log analysis and performance smoke helpers.

The maintained validation matrix lives in [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/). Renderer and
output performance expectations live in [Performance](/docs/operations/performance/), and the
runtime security model lives in [Security](/docs/operations/security/).

## Future Features

### MIDI Follow-On Work

The native MIDI foundation and UC-33e/mioXC profile shipped as experimental in
0.9.5 and commissioning continues in 0.9.6. Follow-on work after that:

- Direct UC-33e USB support after the DIN/mioXC path is stable.
- Physical Windows and Linux validation beyond CI builds and fake event tests.
- Mapping profile import/export beyond locally persisted MIDI Learn overrides.
- Additional controller profiles.
- Optional deadband and per-binding smoothing controls in the mapping UI.
- Automatic construction/editing of proprietary UC-33e SysEx without first
  capturing a verified full-bank hardware dump.

Regression rule: MIDI must keep using the same live-control paths as the UI and
must not gain source, Camera, Pop Out, or output-display actions without a new
product decision and security review.

### Productized Stream Mode

Promote stream mode only when it is coherent for normal users.

Scope:

- Decide whether the normal stream path is Rust/FFmpeg, a bundled sidecar, an
  external-server connector, or a combination.
- Keep Python/FastAPI as a development/reference path unless explicitly
  packaged.
- Add a clear Stream source workflow without polluting the default Source panel.
- Restore stream-specific metrics only when useful: buffer, wire/raw bandwidth,
  codec mode, stream latency, reinit status.
- Preserve native output and preset transition behavior in stream mode.
- Verify WebSocket control-message behavior for soft and reinit params.
- Add end-to-end stream smoke tests with representative media.

### Native System Audio Improvements

Improve desktop system audio capture while keeping audio features local.

Scope:

- macOS: migrate from ScreenCaptureKit system-audio fallback toward Core Audio
  Taps so the app can request a narrower System Audio Recording permission where
  possible.
- Windows: add WASAPI loopback.
- Linux: add PipeWire/PulseAudio providers.
- Keep feature frames bounded. Do not stream unbounded raw audio samples over
  Tauri IPC.
- Preserve Web Audio mic/input behavior as the browser-compatible fallback.

### Direct Camera Texture Pipelines

Continue reducing camera latency and copy overhead.

Scope:

- macOS: AVFoundation/CVPixelBuffer to Metal texture sharing.
- Windows: Media Foundation to D3D texture sharing.
- Linux: PipeWire/V4L2 to Vulkan/GLES interop where realistic.
- Native multi-camera mixing without forcing all paths through WebView canvas
  readback.
- Keep latest-frame semantics for live performance instead of buffering old
  camera frames.

### Rendering Engine Consolidation

Reduce duplicated shader/math behavior across browser GPU, Canvas, stream, and
native output paths.

0.9.2 status:

- Shared JavaScript render math helpers and vector fixtures exist under
  `renderers/shared/`.
- GPU color-processing vectors are consumed by both JavaScript and Rust native
  output tests.
- Canvas and stream color helpers remain intentionally legacy-named and
  behavior-preserving. Full numerical unification is still future work.

Scope:

- Define a renderer parameter schema shared by UI, presets, audio, WTF, MIDI,
  browser renderers, stream renderers, and native output.
- Keep color processing numerically consistent across WebGPU, WebGL2, Canvas,
  and native `wgpu`.
- Add golden-output or bounded visual tests for representative presets.
- Make backend fallbacks visible and diagnosable.
- Continue preserving WebGPU/WebGL visual quality while improving native-output
  latency.

### Preset and Profile Management

Expand user-facing preset workflows.

Scope:

- Rename user presets.
- Startup preset selection.
- Preset folders/tags.
- Preset search/filter.
- Separate preset packs from MIDI mappings.
- Import validation with readable errors.
- Export bundles containing visual presets, audio-reactive settings, and future
  MIDI profiles without including private media paths.

### Release Hardening

Move from local/self-signed packages to a smoother public distribution path.

0.9.3 status:

- macOS public release CI requires Developer ID signing/notarization credentials
  and verifies codesign, hardened runtime, DMG/app Gatekeeper acceptance, and
  notarization state before publishing.
- Windows 0.9.3 release CI publishes unsigned preview artifacts instead of
  blocking on paid Azure Artifact Signing.
- Local development keeps an explicitly opted-in, permission-disposable ad-hoc
  fallback; normal permission testing requires stable signing.
- Normal local commands isolate the dev product/bundle identity, disable the
  production updater, and require stable signing before permission testing.
- macOS release gates verify the exact production Team ID and designated
  requirement in both the app and extracted updater archive.
- Published-release CI performs a real macOS updater replacement from the
  preceding eligible release and revalidates the resulting identity.
- Real clean-machine Windows install behavior remains a manual release check for
  preview artifacts and a required validation point once Windows signing is
  enabled.

Scope:

- macOS Developer ID signing and notarization:
  - enroll and maintain Apple Developer Program credentials for release signing.
  - store Developer ID certificate and notarization credentials as GitHub
    Actions secrets.
  - build macOS release artifacts with hardened runtime enabled.
  - submit macOS app bundles or DMGs to Apple notarization during release CI.
  - staple notarization tickets to shipped artifacts.
  - validate final artifacts with `codesign --verify`, entitlement inspection,
    `spctl -a -vv`, and a first-open smoke test on a clean macOS machine.
  - keep ad-hoc signing only as an explicit permission-disposable development
    fallback.
- Windows SmartScreen mitigation:
  - sign Windows installers and executables with an Authenticode code-signing
    certificate.
  - prefer EV code signing if distribution volume or user friction justifies
    the cost and token/CI workflow complexity.
  - add timestamping so signatures remain valid after certificate expiry.
  - keep publisher name, app name, installer metadata, and version metadata
    stable across releases to build reputation.
  - publish release artifacts consistently through GitHub Releases and the
    Tauri updater.
  - document expected first-install SmartScreen behavior while reputation is
    building.
  - smoke-test install/open/update behavior on clean Windows machines, not only
    hosted CI runners.
- Future SignPath Foundation / OSI-license distribution track:
  - treat SignPath Foundation as the preferred no-recurring-cost Windows
    signing path if the project can satisfy its open-source, policy, and
    reproducible-build requirements.
  - do not change the project license to plain MIT until ASCILINE-derived
    source has either been relicensed with upstream permission or replaced by
    behavior-preserving clean-room implementations.
  - first freeze the current behavior with regression coverage for startup,
    static media, camera, Canvas2D/pixel Canvas output, audio-reactive vectors,
    native output, stream compatibility where retained, updater assets, and
    release smoke flows.
  - rewrite inherited product-surface files from documented behavior/specs
    rather than refactoring copied implementation in place.
  - remove or clearly de-scope legacy Python/streaming files from public
    release eligibility if they remain under the current upstream license.
  - publish a code-signing policy covering release authority, SignPath signing
    flow, source/release traceability, maintainer identities, and vulnerability
    disclosure.
  - update privacy documentation for production crash reports before submitting
    a SignPath Foundation application.
  - restructure Windows release CI so SignPath-signed artifacts and Tauri
    updater `.sig` files are generated in the correct order, then verify
    Authenticode signatures and updater signatures before publishing.
  - keep Azure Artifact Signing or unsigned Windows preview artifacts as a
    fallback until SignPath acceptance and release CI are proven.
- Windows installer smoke tests on real machines beyond CI.
- Linux AppImage/deb validation across common distributions.
- Manual clean-machine confirmation that TCC grants remain present across the
  automated, identity-stable updater hop.
- Fixed WebView2 runtime strategy if the Windows app must install without
  online prerequisites.

### Performance Harness

Build repeatable performance tests for renderer and output regressions.

Scope:

- Optimized-build tests only for output-window performance claims.
- Main-window FPS and output-window FPS measured separately.
- Camera latency tests with synthetic or timestamped frames.
- Preset transition smoothness checks.
- Audio-reactivity response-time checks.
- Native output logs with counters for acquired frames, presented frames, param
  version, source version, and display pacing.

### Documentation and Examples

Turn the repo docs into a maintained documentation set.

Scope:

- Keep README user-focused.
- Keep contributor docs tested.
- Keep rendering-engine docs aligned with code changes.
- Keep [Security](/docs/operations/security/), [Performance](/docs/operations/performance/),
  [Testing](/docs/operations/testing/), [Accessibility](/docs/operations/accessibility/), and
  [Internationalization](/docs/operations/internationalization/) aligned with the native desktop architecture.
- Add screenshots of the black UI theme for normal user setup, Pop Out, and
  permissions workflows.
- Add hardware setup guides for cameras, audio interfaces, projectors, and the
  UC-33e/mioXC rig.
- Add a troubleshooting matrix for permissions, GPU fallback, and output-window
  issues.
- Add automated accessibility checks for keyboard/focus/ARIA behavior.
- Add a bundled i18n catalog only when there is a real localization workflow.

## Open Risks

- WebGPU support varies across browsers and Tauri webviews.
- Linux WebGPU support may remain inconsistent for a while.
- Multi-camera capture depends on OS, camera firmware, USB topology, and browser
  behavior.
- macOS privacy prompts remain sensitive to bundle identifier and signing
  identity; production/dev isolation prevents normal local builds from
  contaminating public grants.
- FFmpeg licensing must remain an explicit release gate.
- Native media decode and GPU interop differ significantly by platform.
- High-rate MIDI events can still cause renderer churn when users map many
  structural controls simultaneously; continuous events are coalesced and
  structural changes remain rate-limited.
- Streaming must not return to the normal UI until it is reliable enough for
  non-developer users.

## Definition of Done for 1.0

- App installs cleanly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Desktop app works offline except for deliberate update checks.
- Demo Image, Demo Video, custom files, and Camera work from first launch.
- Pop Out is performant and stable on the primary supported platforms.
- Presets, WTF, audio reactivity, and live controls do not restart media unless
  the user changes source or a structural rebuild is unavoidable.
- Stream mode is either productized or clearly absent from normal-user UI.
- MIDI controller support remains stable on the documented UC-33e/mioXC rig.
- macOS release artifacts are Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled, and
  Gatekeeper-validated for public distribution, or the release is explicitly
  marked as a local/test build.
- Windows release artifacts are either explicitly marked as unsigned previews or
  are Authenticode signed, timestamped, and tested against SmartScreen behavior
  on clean machines, with remaining first-install warnings documented.
- Rendering-engine docs, contributor docs, and changelog match the release.
