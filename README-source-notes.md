# Source ingestion notes

Generated with the `product-marketing-docs-builder` operating pattern.

## Sources read

- ASCII VJ Remix: README, CHANGELOG, AGENTS, SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCESSIBILITY, I18N, TESTING, CONTRIBUTORS, RENDERING_ENGINE, package scripts, Tauri config, Cargo manifest, style.css, demo assets, and the approved canonical app icon.
- Architecture reference: pool-marketing-docs Jekyll/just-the-docs layout, Sass, includes, Gemfile, GitHub Pages workflow, docs taxonomy.

## Style extraction

- ASCII VJ Remix: dark background `#040506`, panels `#090a0c` / `#101216`, cyan `#00e5ff`, pink `#ff2bd6`, white text, VCR OSD Mono, square controls, console/control-surface density.

## 1.0.3 refresh

- Verified the published [v1.0.3 release](https://github.com/aindaco1/ascii-vj-remix/releases/tag/v1.0.3) and its macOS, Windows, Linux, and updater assets on 2026-09-05.
- The source changelog entry is dated 2026-09-02; GitHub publication occurred on 2026-09-05 UTC. `_data/product.yml` retains the changelog date used by the sync pipeline.
- Read the source `docs/RELEASE_1.0.3.md` acceptance record alongside the durable guides. Windows development-candidate hardware acceptance is recorded; Ubuntu/Fedora camera hardware testing remains deferred.
- Checked the source preset backend contract (71 total, 43 accelerated, 28 Canvas) and README palette catalog (17 palettes). Refreshed both homepages and the English/Spanish documentation, including 1.0.1 playlists, PNG capture, and manual diagnostics and the 1.0.2 output-worker fixes.
- Preserved the existing artwork, video, layout, and shared support/download components.

## Claims policy

This site only makes claims supported by ASCII VJ Remix source docs/config/scripts. It does not claim signed Windows artifacts or completed release builds beyond source repo documentation.

The mother repository owns technical truth. The marketing repository owns the
curated public narrative, generated presentation, localization, and deployment;
its sync script copies canonical sections and the approved icon rather than
maintaining parallel technical descriptions.
